If you make a Bootable Linux USB and receive the following error

<strong></strong><strong>No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!</strong>
<strong>boot:</strong>

Then simply go back and format your USB as FAT not FAT32, then recopy/re-install your Distro onto the USB stick. Â Problem Solved.
