# Do you need to blur out sections of your browser/webpages to be able to make blogs/videos without using video filters?

Microsoft recently held a hacakathon and a very useful output of that was a Browser Extension called "CloudCloak".  
Easy to download, install and enable, it allows you to filter/blur out a number of possible pieces of data that you wouldn't want to share in a blog post or YouTube video.

This means you can open up your Azure subscription, Entra ID, even client keys and secrets, as well as URLs and they all get blanked out as shown below.
