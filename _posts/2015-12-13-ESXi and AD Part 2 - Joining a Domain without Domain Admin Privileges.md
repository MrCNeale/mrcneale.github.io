I have an e-mail from VMware support stating the following
<I>"I've discussed this issue with my escalation engineer's. 

To add/join the ESXi host to AD you need to have a Domain Admin privilege. 

This email can be considered to be an official document, however if you have any more queries, please reply back to this email."</I>
