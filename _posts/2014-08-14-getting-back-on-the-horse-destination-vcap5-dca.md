After passing my VCP, and subsequently falling back into the bad habit of not studying! I've managed to get the
<ul>
	<li>VMware authorisation</li>
	<li>Pearson Vue confirmation
and now</li>
	<li>A voucher (for the $$$ bit) from my lovely employer :-)</li>
</ul>
Well ok the last bit has been all rubber stamped and approved but it's somewhere in our suppliers system to churn a handle to actual give me a code....anyway that's an aside, as soon as it comes through I'll be booking the exam on pearson giving myself 3months/12weeks to prep.

The point is........IT'S BACK ON! Â I'll be studying again and blurting out blogposts about the activity.

As always, step 1 is READ THE BLUEPRINT!
