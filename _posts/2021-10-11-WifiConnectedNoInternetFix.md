<H1>"Wi-Fi has no internet access"</H1>
If you're connecting your Android phone to a network and find that everything else connects to that network fine except your phone and you get the above error, this could be the fix.

<P>
You've already tried
* Rebooting
* Resetting Network Settings
* Factory Reset (really?)
* Connecting to another WiFi network
* Other stuff that XDA forums, Tom's Hardware etc. recommend

The one that I didn't see on any searches was "Set your Date & Time" correctly.<BR>
I was resetting a phone to sell on ebay.  It hadn't been powered on for a while, and the clock was out by 3 years.  As it had no SIM card in, it couldn't get the time automatically from the Mobile Network provider.
<BR>
As soon as the time was set correctly then I could access web pages.  To remove the warning of "has no internet access" I had to reconnect to the wifi network after fixing the time.

  Hope that saves someone else
