Well that&rsquo;s simple.  Not enough lab time.</p><p>It sounds obvious but it really really can&rsquo;t be overstated.  There were 26 tasks on the exam and 3.5hrs to do them in.  That&rsquo;s less than 7 minutes per task.  Don&rsquo;t forget it takes a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the exam environment and hostnames/ips.  So think 6 minutes per task.</p><p>Jason Nash in the Optimise and Scale (I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was) said &ldquo;Think of it as a customer asking you to do some work but they can only pay for 3.5hrs&rdquo;</p><p>I would put it slightly differently, and this is where the blueprint comes in.</p><p>Think of the Blueprint (and definitely Chris Wahl&rsquo;s Study Sheet/Checklist) as a list of things you will need to do for the customer.  It&rsquo;s their requirements doc.  It&rsquo;s not specific.  The IPs or hosts or networks or VMs details will be given to you in the task &ldquo;on the day&rdquo;.  But they have an outage window of 3.5 hrs with a hard stop.  You need to have done what they need in that time as users will be let back on the environment afterwards.</p><p>Given that premise then you need to be able to do each and every one of the Blueprint/Checklist tasks in 5 minutes.  Not think you can.  Not do it once.  I mean you need to drill yourself on it.
If the task is (and I&rsquo;ll quote blueprint/checklist items here) change a pathing policy then all you should need it the LUN/Path/Disk detail and which policy.  Bosh.
If the task is migrate all of a host&rsquo;s, or specific standard, switches to a DVSwitch then 5 minutes later. Bosh.
Set up FT? 5 minutes Bosh!</p><p>You get the idea.  If you have to think too long about it, you will waste too much time
(I do think it&rsquo;s a bit harsh they take your watch off you when you go into the test room!)</p><p>A mini resource review is:</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
