So I have my nested esxi lab environment running in workstation 10.  All was going well until I tried to test out some VMware Update Manager tasks.  I had installed VUM on a 2k3 VM running on one of my esxi hosts (I may break it out to run in workstation when I have more memory).  I could scan/remediate the host the VM was on, but I couldn&rsquo;t scan the other host.  I tried vmotioning the VM.  It failed&mldr;due to a networking issue.  I cold vmotioned the powered off VM and started it on the 2nd host and VUM could scan it&mldr;but not the original host.</p><p>A quick run through was that the hosts could ping the default gateway (the VMWorkstation switch) they could even both see my Synology NAS and mount/map NFS/iSCSI LUNs.  But they couldn&rsquo;t ping each other.  They could ping everything else and everything else could ping them.  They had just plain fallen out with each other!</p><p>I ran over the network config in workstation and there is very little to customise on a per-vm setting.  Plus they were just NAT&rsquo;d exactly the same as the other VMs.
VMworkstation Virtual Network ruled out.</p><p>So it was something specific to both hosts.  Now foolishly I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of lab exercises and not got my esxi hosts set to have non-persistent disks.  So somewhere in the last week or so I have changed the networking and not recorded/documented the random PowerCLI/esxcli/vma command which has stopped them talking.</p><p>Then I had an epiphany.  I don&rsquo;t need to know what&rsquo;s different.  I&rsquo;ll just use vSphere/vCenter to set them the same!</p><p>Simple Solution</p><ol><li>Create host profile of HostA</li><li>Apply host profile to HostB</li></ol>And voila.  Ping was working!
