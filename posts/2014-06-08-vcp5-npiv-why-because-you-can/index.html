Rarely comes up in conversation these days&rdquo;</strong></p><p>So there we have it. It&rsquo;s like Print Services for Unix in Windows.  It&rsquo;s possible, but no-one uses it!!!! :-)</p><p><a href=https://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/npiv.png><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-164" src="http://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/npiv.png?w=300" alt=npiv width=300 height=267></a></p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
