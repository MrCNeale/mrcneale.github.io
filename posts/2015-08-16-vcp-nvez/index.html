Straight after the exam I went on holiday and on coming back I got straight back into work.</p><p>My background is working with VMware since Esx 2.x in 2005. In a more structured and career focussed way since 2011 when I did a great project to deploy 4 vBlocks with Linked vCenters. Since then I&rsquo;ve worked on various virtualisation deployments, upgrades, support incidents (the joys of being on-call) and even a brief foray into setting up a Hyper-V environment for one customer!!!</p><p>I did the original ICM for VI3, but didn&rsquo;t get round the sitting the exam. Very slack of me and something I won&rsquo;t repeat. So to catch up and qualify to sit VCP4 I did the VMWN4 course to gen up but mainly to meet the requirements. I passed VCP4 a few years back and updated to VCP5 last summer. This year I got involved in a great project to deploy NSX as part of a new offering, so breaking some fresh ground and it really re-engergised my enthusiasm.</p><p>I was fortunate to do the ICM NSX 6.1 course in June. However I would say that if you&rsquo;ve used NSX and are familiar with the major concepts then you will be a long way to knowing the VCP-NV Blueprint material</p><p>So what&rsquo;s the point of the history lesson? Also some of you may be shouting &ldquo;arrogance&rdquo; or &ldquo;clickbait&rdquo; over the post&rsquo;s title. (The EZ/Easy bit).</p><p>Well my point is I&rsquo;ve been in IT since desktop support in 1996 through to now and I&rsquo;ve tracerouted and configured some basic Cisco routers for remote access but never delved into other switch/router makes or done much more than route/ipconfig/arp before handing config or diagnosis on to dedicated network folks.</p><p>So armed with</p><li>Basic networking skills</li><li>Quite a few years of vSphere Standard and Distributed switches under my belt</li><li>Just the depth of route redistribution and protocols such as OSPF/BGP/IS-IS that is delivered in the ICM</li>I undertook the VCP-NV.<p>So I studies to the blueprint, plus some rudimentary networkng knowledge and the nuances of SDN and I passed.</p><p>So what is my summary?</p><li>It was a very poorly written exam. There were typos which could mislead you. There were also plenty of questions which in a real-life scenario you'd ask a quick clarifying question to remove ambiguity</li><li>I feel there was a big overlap in the blueprint of VCP-DCV material relating to VSS and VDS. So if you are already familiar with those then you've covered quite a bit of the blueprint with your existing knowledge</li><li>It's two to three weeks study, depending on your existing networking skills. e.g. if you have a CCIE/CCNA plus VCP-DCV then it will be a walk in the park!</li><p>So my point was that whilst I still get confused a bit with OSPF/BGP and &ldquo;Not So Stubby Areas&rdquo; (NSSA) I&rsquo;m still comfortable with the material outlined in the blueprint from a depth enough to pass.</p><p>If you know vSphere and know networking then I&rsquo;d say GO FOR IT!</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
