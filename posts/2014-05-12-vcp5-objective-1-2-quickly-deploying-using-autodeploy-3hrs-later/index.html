Well no such luck. I powered on my Microserver host and the vCenter appliance fired up with it automatically. Nice!
Logged on to the web client and the fat client. I have been trying to alternate between the two to make sure I can spot any differences, or things you can&rsquo;t do in one but can in the other."><meta property="og:title" content="VCP5 - Objective 1.2 &#34;Quickly&#34; Deploying Using AutoDeploy (3hrs later!!! ;-)"><meta property="og:description" content="So tonight&rsquo;s revision was meant to be pretty quick. It is Game Of Thrones night after all!

Sizing the DB was simple.  Go to Home->Administration->vCenter Server Settings->Statistics.  From there you can plug in your number of hosts/vms and frequency of stat collection.  This will show you estimated DB usage so you can resize your newly created VCenter DB as appropriate.</p><p>Next on to AutoDeploy.  I have the vCenter Appliance installed so I logged in to it via https on port 5480 and started the autodeploy service.  A quick trip back to the full vi client and voila, under Home->Administration, AutoDeploy has now appeared.  The slight surprise was that there ain&rsquo;t much to config.  This is where RTFM comes in and you find you need a DHCP server (or to set the config on your existing one) to point to your TFTP server (which you need to setup/install).</p><p>I did a quick search for a pre-packaged v.appliance, but none sprang out from the marketplace (which seemed a bit flaky).  So I opted for a Linux box.  Trying to be clever I picked an older distro of Ubuntu v9 to try and make install quicker.  But that backfired so here I am leaving the host and my NAS (serving an iSCSI lun to my ESXi host) on overnight to update flipping Linux!</p><p>Lesson learned!  Just not the intended one for tonight.</p><p>&mldr;Tomorrow night&mldr;.actually doing something with AutoDeploy other than just switching it on :-)</p><p></p><p> </p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
