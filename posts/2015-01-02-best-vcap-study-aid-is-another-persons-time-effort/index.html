Both of those you can configure and add easily yourself</li></ul>Nothing amazing thus far.  But here is the great bit.  Just before VMworld 2012 Josh created his lab on a laptop roughly described above.<ul><li>He then went further and wrote some scenarios that you should know if you're going to attempt VCAP-DCA.  Currently these focus on VM management, Storage Management, Network Management and Miscellaneous tasks.</li><li>He wrote four sets of these.</li><li>His lab also contains scripts to reboot and reset the lab in between Sets of tasks</li><li>He also wrote powershell scripts to check your homework!
It's pretty amazing and the final amazing part is..........</li><li>He let's strangers on to this lab remotely!!!!  Giving away his compute, electricity and hard work for the benefit of fellow VMware enthusiasts.</li></ul>I think this is a great example of how the VMware community can really do amazing things.  Taking time out of his day to setup and schedule me a slot to use his lab and scenarios has really boosted my thirst for learning.  I quickly realised there were some areas I needed to brush up.  But in others I confirmed what I knew and I even found a glitch in one of the scoring scripts ;-)  (That is in no way a criticism as the lab was set up some time ago and any edits can easily be lost with the non-persistent disks and also covers 5.1 and 5.5)<p>Josh is already, unsurprisingly, a vExpert and a VCI/VCP/VCAP&mldr;&mldr;  If you&rsquo;re looking for something to test our your skills and to inspire you to better automate and configure you own home lab then I highly recommend looking through Josh&rsquo;s posts and getting in touch with him via Twitter or e-mail.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where I got started with Josh&rsquo;s Test Track</p><p><a href=http://sostechblog.com/2014/02/07/vcap-test-track-lab-on-a-lap/>http://sostechblog.com/2014/02/07/vcap-test-track-lab-on-a-lap/</a></p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
