Yes of course, it&rsquo;s not rocket science.  But like most people trying these things out time is a commodity rarer than gold.  So rather than faff with oem.tgz and redo-ing an ISO image with linux DD commands I borrowed another NIC from a friend.  Unfortunately that didn&rsquo;t work either so I have resigned myself to having to purchase an Intel Pro 1000 GT or similar compatible card.</p><p>Now my previous job wasn&rsquo;t as auspicious as my current employer, but it did come with some great perks such as having access to lots of &ldquo;spare&rdquo; hardware.  I vividly remember a draw brimming over with Intel NICs&mldr;. I can even remember the chipset number 82557.  Oh to be able to lay my hands on one of these now!  An Intel Pro 1000 GT comes in at around £22 for my cheapest local supplier, or free delivery.  Similar prices can be found for other, what I thought would be, common NICs.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well the only answer I can come up with is Supply and Demand.  All home motherboards now come with an on-board gigabit NIC, some even 2 and they don&rsquo;t have to be high end boards.   All servers HP/Dell etc. come with dual port NICs on-board as standard too.  So the need or demand for seperate PCI cards must have dwindled.  A number of friends or colleagues I told or asked as a tested all responded the same &ldquo;ahh you&rsquo;ll pick one of those up for a tenner&mldr;&rdquo;  Only to be baffled when I told them that the rarity of these items means they are now like precious metals!  I also searched for a 3com905c-tx which came in at about £10 but that&rsquo;s one ancient Network Interface Card.  All in the name of compatibility.</p><p>The moral of the story?  Not sure there is one really, perhaps it&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t let anyone throw away working Tech and store it somewhere, even if it&rsquo;s a friends garage and you pay storage costs in beer.  It will come in handy one day&mldr;or may even accumulate value somehow!</p><p>And with that&mldr;&mldr;.I&rsquo;m off to research how to modify oem.tgz (coz I&rsquo;m tight! :-)</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
