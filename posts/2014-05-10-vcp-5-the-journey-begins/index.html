Shortly after (very shortly!) those pesky developers released vSphere5. VMware generously allowed VCP4&rsquo;s to upgrade by the end of Feb 2012. Whilst that was generous, at the time my brain was frazzled from VCP4 study, I&rsquo;d only just really got stuck in to vSphere4 deployments and wanted to get hands-on v5 experience before I sat the VCP5 exam.</p><p>Time passed. VCP split into VCP-DCV, VCP-Cloud, VCP-DT. V5.0, 5.1 and now 5.5 have been released. Anyway, having missed the Feb 29th deadline I asked for an upgrade course, VMWN5. For various reasons that didn&rsquo;t materialise and so I was in the limbo of feeling ready to study and sit my VCP5 but not having the qualifying course, e.g. ICM or What&rsquo;s New.</p><p>Now my employer is a VMware Partner and I&rsquo;d already been taking advantage of the VMware Partner University and got my VTSP5. Although this is a slightly &ldquo;salesy&rdquo; qualification it is certainly a lot more technical than most &ldquo;free&rdquo; accreditations out there. It&rsquo;s purpose, as I understand it, is to give you the skills to suggest vSphere solutions to meet customers requirements and needs. The kind of skills you would need for a Technical Sales Engineer type role, say.</p><p>So there I sat in limbo, I&rsquo;d taken advantage of what I could without deciding on shelling out Â£2500 of my own money to do the ICM course. Then along came a mail. Partners were being given the opportunity to sit the VCP5 as long as they had VCP4 and/or VCP3 and relevant experience with vSphere5.</p><p>After a lot of fiddling about to get pre-authorised and then finding some vouchers didn&rsquo;t work, it was confirmed yesterday that the exam would be approved and that I can sit it.</p><p>So here begins my journey. I will be blogging it as much for my own purposes. If someone else finds this useful great. I know that I&rsquo;m probably 10,987th in the line of people to do a &ldquo;my vcp revision blog&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m going to be looking for others who have done so already and referencing them heavily (with credit of course!).</p><p>As Scott Vesey said when I did the ICM VI3 course and the VMWN4.1 course (and on his blog) the simple key to the exam is BLUEPRINT BLUEPRINT BLUEPRINT
If it&rsquo;s not on the Blueprint. It won&rsquo;t be in the exam. So don&rsquo;t waste time studying it.</p><p>As such I&rsquo;ll be following the tried and tested route of many others of writing a post per objective.
There are 7 Sections, each with 2 to 5 objectives. Each objective has between 23 and 46 &ldquo;knowledge items&rdquo;
This may sound daunting but someone&rsquo;s already broken down those hundreds of bits of knowledge and if you&rsquo;ve used vSphere5 lots and installed it and if you have a homelab of any sort then between practical and documentation you should be able to read about it, e.g. the available editions of vCenter, or do it, for say expanding a Thin-Provisioned disk to Thick.</p><p>Next up brief post about me and my setup and revision plan, then straight into the objectives.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
