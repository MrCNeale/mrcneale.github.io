The Key Management Service (KMS) determined that the request timestamp is invalid.</td><td>KMS client</td><td>The system time on the client computer is too different from the time on the KMS host.</td><td>Time sync is important to system and network security for a variety of reasons. Fix this issue by changing the system time on the client to sync with the KMS. Use of a Network Time Protocol (NTP) time source or Active Directory Domain Services for time synchronization is recommended. This issue uses UTP time and is independent of Time Zone selection.</td></tr></tbody></table>So after manually updating the clock (and date...ahem) to the correct time and then syncing up with the DC<p><strong>w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update</strong></p><p><strong>net stop w32time </strong>
