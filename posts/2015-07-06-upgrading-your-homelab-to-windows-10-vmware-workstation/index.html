</a></b>to his communities post pointing out that bug fixes to Workstation 11 had been made to smooth operation with WS11 running on Windows 10.  Those same fixes didn&rsquo;t appear in recent updates to Workstation 10.</p><p>That&rsquo;s fine.  I understand things move with the times but now Windows 10 &ldquo;Free Upgrade&rdquo; was looking like it will cost me £105 to upgrade to Workstation 11.  So I thought I&rsquo;d try something crazy.</p><p>On my Windows 8.1 PC I created a VM inside Workstation 10.
On that VM I installed Windows 10.
On that VM I then installed Workstation 10 (which did warn me against running WS on a virtual machine)
I then created a Debian 64bit VM with 2GB memory and it ran fine.</p><p>So, whilst it likely to be wholly unsupported and any problems that occur would come with the fix &ldquo;Upgrade to Workstation 11&rdquo;.</p><p>It is possible to run VMware Workstation 10 on Windows 10&mldr;..!</p><p><em><strong>(NOTE: It is necessary to run Workstation as administrator or you will get an error about writing to a user folder&mldr;possibly something that can be changed with UAC or a shortcut pre-set to run as admin)</strong></em></p><p><a href=https://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/ws10inaw10vm.png><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256" src=https://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/ws10inaw10vm.png alt=ws10inaw10vm width=660 height=490></a></p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
