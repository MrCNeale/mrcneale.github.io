I suddenly realised, but had never really considered.  That I was running Win7 Home Premium.  It had sufficed for the last 5 years and like most others I had been in no rush to jump to Windows 8.</p><p>A quick visit to MS confirmed my suspicions.</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx#physical_memory_limits_windows_7">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx#physical_memory_limits_windows_7</a></p><p>I&rsquo;ll confess to doing a quick google to see if there was something as cheeky as a reg hack around this &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; it quickly became apparent there wasn&rsquo;t (Kernel hacking isn&rsquo;t something I really fancy).</p><p>So what were my options.</p><p> </p><p>I&rsquo;ll update you on which route I decide</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
