NO-ONE does that, so why is there a question on it!!!"</strong></em></p><p>So after reading the first objective about vcenter/vsphere editions I moved on to Installing ESXi.  I&rsquo;ve done this tons of times.  However I&rsquo;ve never used Auto Deploy.</p><p>Auto Deploy was new in vSphere 5 and if you skim read the blog posts or documentation headings then you might well presume it&rsquo;s just Automated Install.  A robot that once set up will dump a specified ESXi image on a server, then it&rsquo;s back to you.</p><p>Well it&rsquo;s much more than that.  After my first successful Auto-Deploy I checked the Console of the machine and thought, &ldquo;ok so I need to set DHCP now&rdquo;.  Then I wondered how it had carved up the disk I&rsquo;d assigned it.  Hang on a sec. It&rsquo;s only utilised a few Kb of the 5Gb I&rsquo;d assigned it.  I then went to look at it&rsquo;s storage and saw this message.</p><p><a href=http://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/autodep3.png><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-137" src="http://chrisneale.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/autodep3.png?w=300" alt=autodep3 width=300 height=162></a></p><p>Then it dawned on me (and I remembered a distant bit of documentation).  Auto Deploy loads ESXi into memory.  It doesn&rsquo;t do a traditional install.  Then words like stateless and stateful started popping back into my brain and I remembered that you can, depending on the powercli you define, and the host profile you apply, have ESXi built/loaded on the fly every time it boots.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well think about it.  You get a standard image.  You can tell them all to have a consistent host profile.  It will automatically place your host in the folder you specify in vCenter.</p><p>All great, but a big shift from how people normally work and think.  There are still plenty of Service Managers obsessed with &ldquo;which host is VM x running on?&rdquo;.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable with it then fine.  Go for a stateful install and then you are using Auto-Deploy just like HP/Altiris RDP or Tivoli or SCCM etc. (but with much more VMware integration and flexibility).  The size of your environment also will dictate if this configuration is worth it.  It&rsquo;s not hugely time consuming but it does add a little bit of time to your deployment.  Not forgetting that whoever will be looking after the environment after you&rsquo;ve gone will need to understand it!</p><p>The activities are:</p><ol><li>Install vCenter (either on your first host as a VM or on a physical)</li><li>Install Auto-Deploy (either by starting it on the VCA or installing it on the vCenter server or another valid server)</li><li>Configure your tftp & dhcp server (very quick and easy if you're using the VCA)</li><li>Install powercli somewhere</li><li>Download the "Offline Bundle" zip of your chosen ESXi 5.x image</li><li>Add the zip to the Auto-Deploy server using powercli</li><li>Create an Auto-Deploy rule specifying the image to use etc. using powercli</li><li>Assign that rule as the default rule</li><li>PXE boot a new host (physical or a sneaky virtual with 2Gb min and cores)</li></ol>That is where I got to.  However I missed out<p>6b.  Create a host profile for your new host(s) (this should include where in vCenter you want the host to be put)
7b.  Ensure the Auto-Deploy rule includes the host profile you want</p><p>This blog post will give you a great overview
