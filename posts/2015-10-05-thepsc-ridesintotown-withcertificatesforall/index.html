VCSA did a great job at removing not just vCenter but a number of the vSphere components like dump collector, log browser, syslog collector and auto deploy.</p><p>But to have a fully tidy and enterprise environment you needed certificates. You could buy these from Verisign/Symantec but as only internal people will be accessing your vSphere environment then why go to the expense and faff?
The other option is a Windows PKI. Free/Easy and quick to set up (possibly quite badly) but you&rsquo;ve already got Windows servers, why not just add a role?</p><p>So what have VMware done to remove some of this hassle and add to their portfolio? Well a while back they released vSphere 6.0 If you haven&rsquo;t looked at it I recommend setting it up in a lab and getting familiar. It has one key new component that I think is pretty cool.</p><h1>The PSC</h1>PSC deals with identity management for administrators and applications that interact with the vSphere platform and more.
It hosts a bunch of services, some existing some new<li>VMware Appliance Management Service (only in Appliance-based PSC)</li><li>VMware License Service</li><li>VMware Component Manager</li><li>VMware Identity Management Service</li><li>VMware HTTP Reverse Proxy</li><li>VMware Service Control Agent</li><li>VMware Security Token Service</li><li>VMware Common Logging Service</li><li>VMware Syslog Health Service</li><li>VMware Authentication Framework</li><li>VMware Certificate Service</li><li>VMware Directory Service</li><p>My favourite bit, having become an Identity&Access Management SME by stealth is the Certificate service. In my experience customers struggle to really grasp what a PKI is for and to understand the relatively simple moving parts.</p><ol>Certificate Authorities - They issue certs!</ol><ol>Certificate Revocation lists (CRLs) - Lists of revoked certificates</ol><ol>Crl Distribution Points (CDPs) - a Point where CRLs are hosted that clients can connect to and download the latest CRL</ol>That simplifies things down to their minimum. There are other bits but we don't need them yet.<p>To secure a connection a service needs an SSL cert.
e.g. the Web Client Service. has a cert but it issued it to itself. Nothing trusts it, there&rsquo;s nowhere to check if it&rsquo;s been revoked and it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;re accessing it using an ip/name different to the one in the cert.</p><p>The advantage of the Certificate Service or VMCA is that it simplifies or automates a lot of these processes for you, including the setting up of the Root CA.<br>Here&rsquo;s a video overviewing the certificate services in vSphere6.0</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaBF11Vd6aM frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In a follow up post I&rsquo;ll contrast setting up a windows CA and manually issuing certs out to each versus the PSC.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
