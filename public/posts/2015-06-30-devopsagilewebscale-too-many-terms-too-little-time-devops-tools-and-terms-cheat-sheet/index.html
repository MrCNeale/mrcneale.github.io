To me it means trying to use tools and alternative project management approaches (Agile) to deliver repeatable things (applications/networks/virtual servers/physical servers) and continue to manage the configuration of those things after you&rsquo;ve deployed them (not just running away).
At work I have recently started working more closely with our SDDC team there is plenty mention of a number of these tools and even the project management methodology of iteratively attempting small chunks of a project is new and interesting."/>

<p>At work I have recently started working more closely with our SDDC team there is plenty mention of a number of these tools and even the project management methodology of iteratively attempting small chunks of a project is new and interesting.  It&rsquo;s sometimes hard not to slip back into old habits of meetings straying into chats, but breaking projects down into very specific/atomic tasks makes ownership clearer and status.</p>
<p>Either something is done or not done, it can&rsquo;t be waiting on the next person.  If it is for them to do then it&rsquo;s a task in their queue. (This is a variation on the Harvard Business idea of Who&rsquo;s Got the Monkey <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey">https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
