<p>It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.<br>
Initially that had me concerned as I came to Azure 12 months ago fresh onto ARM. It was new at first but I didn&rsquo;t have any ASM baggage.
I saw the exam still had lots of ASM content when I looked into it last summer.  But there have been TWO updates to the exam since then.
One in October 2017 and one in January 2018.  These removed old content such as ASM and most of the SQL PaaS objectives.<br>
There is also a style of question on the exam which forms a set.  Once you start one of these sets you can&rsquo;t go back and forth to change your answer.  This isn&rsquo;t bad, it just needs you to remember that you can&rsquo;t use later questions to go back and change an answer you now realise is wrong.</p>
