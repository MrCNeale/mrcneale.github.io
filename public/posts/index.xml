      <title>How to Troubleshoot Azure Self-Hosted Devops Agent issues</title>
      <link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2022-09-05-devopsagenttroubleshooting/</link>

      <description>Why Use Self-Hosted Agents for Devops jobs? We recently had issues with some Devops tasks queuing. This was happening only with the tasks in the job that we run on our self-hosted agents.
Why run our own agents? It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable question. Microsoft provide agents (VMs) pre-configured and ready to run your tasks for you, so why mess about setting up your own?
There is usually a problem or configuration that cannot be solved using the Microsoft Pool of agents as they are selected at random and the only known quantity about them is that they will be selected from a pool that is in the same region as your DevOps Organisation.</description>

      <description>&#34;Wi-Fi has no internet access&#34; If you&#39;re connecting your Android phone to a network and find that everything else connects to that network fine except your phone and you get the above error, this could be the fix. You&#39;ve already tried * Rebooting * Resetting Network Settings * Factory Reset (really?) * Connecting to another WiFi network * Other stuff that XDA forums, Tom&#39;s Hardware etc. recommend The one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see on any searches was &amp;ldquo;Set your Date &amp;amp; Time&amp;rdquo; correctly.</description>

      <description>&#34;Is this Action Group used by any alerts?&#34; If you want to find out if an Action Group is used by any alerts (metric or Log) how do you do it? Two simple queries help here:
To check if any Metric alerts point to your Action Group, run
Get-AzMetricAlertRuleV2 | ?{$_.actions.ActionGroupId -like &amp;#39;YourActionGroupName&amp;#39;} To check if any Log Alerts (Known as Scheduled Query alerts since classic was retired) run</description>

      <title>Powershell to retreive Azure VM Memory Size</title>

      <description>&#34;How much memory do my VMs have?&#34; It seems like an obvious thing to ask. It seems reasonable to me....However without additional tooling, such as inventory or configuration management software, you can&#39;t easily get a list of Azure VMs and their memory sizes that you can manipulate. If you just run &#34;get-azvm&#34; then it returns a property of the vm which is a &#34;HardwareProfile&#34;. This just has a sub property of the VM t-shirt size.</description>

      <description>The Broadest Blueprint yet - In Depth I sat the AZ-500 exam last week. I had set aside some time for study, arranged an exam voucher through work, booked it. All set. I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.</description>

      <description>When is a Culture a Module? Including pre-req checks in your code is good practice&amp;hellip;.so you add it in.
In our Powershell scripts which require Azure Powershell cmdlets we have moved, as should anyone keeping abreast of releases, to Powershell Core.
But our checks to see if the Az Module is installed were giving mixed results.
Even though the commands all worked, Get-AzVM etc. the module check for &amp;ldquo;Az&amp;rdquo; returned nothing, blank, nada.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-103 exam at the end of July, blog post is a little late due to some family stuff, but back on it now. I missed the deadline to do the transition exam, but that wasn&#39;t a big problem as they had replaced the previous requirement of two exams to get Azure Administrator (AZ-100 + AZ-101) down to just one in AZ-103 This exam felt very familiar.</description>

      <description>Practical user for Docker/Containers in infra as code (IaC) - a standard deployment environment &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code, Automate all the things, Containers are the future, DevOPs to the max!&amp;rdquo; has been a chorus of lots of people in tech for a while and as a non-app dev I never really saw applications for containers to help what I do.
What do you do? Good question. Well it involves a lot of ARM template deployments and deploying blueprints and standard environments to run tests against.</description>

      <description>What can you do to find out more about why a VM extension is failing or not working quite right? Azure VMs are great and VM extensions are even better. Either a Vendor, or you, can create some code to do a thing to a VM. Usually install software or agents and configure it. Most common for the average user will be things like the Log Analytics Agent Extension and the Custom Script Extension (where you can run your own Powershell or Bash post install).</description>

      <description>What does Azure have that VMware never had? AKA What is the Azure Instance Metadata Service? There&amp;rsquo;s probably a ton of answers here. But the one I was angling for is &amp;ldquo;Which vCenter is my VM running on?&amp;rdquo;
Who&amp;rsquo;d be crazy enough to lose a VM? Well you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised in enterprise estates that have been running for 10 years and Sue who managed the VM farm just retired and moved to Cypus so you can&amp;rsquo;t get hold of her to ask&amp;hellip; Anyway, what I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about it more useful than just finding out where your VM is if you (or your script/code) only has access inside the VM.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-302 exam on Tuesday. It has been updated since the Beta considerably. Many who took the beta felt that it wasn&#39;t Architect focussed but more developer focussed. Now whilst in this new brave cloud world you have to be part Admin/Pre-Sales/Architect and Developer, writing C# or node.js code in an Architect Exam didn&#39;t seem fair to me either.</description>

      <description>We use Log Analytics to collect logs so that we can query the pooled logs to generate alerts. A common scenario. We had an ARM template that had worked for a long time, but when we had an issue, the first thing Microsoft said was &amp;ldquo;Why are you using such an old version?&amp;rdquo; Ok, we&amp;rsquo;d missed the agent updates on this particular template for Linux, it&amp;rsquo;s always best to be up to date.</description>

      <description>This book was recommended by a friend and the premise of an investigation into how work, progress and prosperity have changed and are changing still was something that interested me....as I’m not independently wealthy or a lottery winner...so I’ll be working for the next 30 years or so! The book is written by 2 MIT research scientists&amp;hellip;hence nearly 100 pages of references, but those are kept for the end for anyone who wants to check their homework and you can skip the graphs if that’s not your thing.</description>

      <description>An Odd Request This implementation started from a SAP team who said they wanted to replicate, in Azure, the AWS Internet Gateway functionality. In particular the option for all outbound traffic from VMs to route via a single outbound IP. As you may know even if your default Azure VM does not have a Public IP assigned to it, it can still access the internet for things like windows updates etc.</description>

      <description>An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the 70-533 exam last Wednesday. It was the version after the Jan 2018 updates. That last bit is critical. Cloud moves fast and Microsoft published the exam 4 years ago. It was originally based around ASM, the white and blue GUI and a different set of PowerShell commands. It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s something no-one should have to see, but sometimes, for brevity it happens. Someone hard codes a password in a script/program &amp;ldquo;just to test&amp;rdquo;. Well it&amp;rsquo;s a bad habit to get in to.</description>

This is a post in two parts, first the exam experience, second a few pondering on VMware Education&amp;rsquo;s current trajectory.
The Day Itself Here in the UK there are only 3, I believe, VCAP accredited test centres. I hopped on a train across to Leeds, that ended up being delayed and I only had time for a coffee and sandiwch before having to get started.</description>

The user was running the scripts under a user local to that computer. They needed to use that to run scripts with the same user before AND after it joined the domain.
I checked the usual, updated a GPO to disable &amp;ldquo;Deny access to this computer from the network&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I was recently creating new users in vsphere.local in a lab environment. When I came to test logging in I got &amp;ldquo;invalid username/password&amp;rdquo; from the web-client.
Hmm odd. So I went back in and checked the username was spelt correctly and reset the password typing slowly.
Back out. Tried login again&amp;hellip;.same error. Ok maybe I&amp;rsquo;m being really fat fingered. Nope I typed the password into a notepad and it was correct.</description>

      <description>Recently Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered a vulnerability in common Linux bootloader GRUB.
It affects GRUB2 specifically and was introduced into that version in 2009
http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2015-8370-Grub2-authentication-bypass.html
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8370
However it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the original GRUB.
I was concerned about the Virtual Appliances we were running in one of our environments.

      <description>Problem You need to join an ESXi host to AD but you do not have Domain Admins. Your AD team ask what rights ESXi requires and you can&amp;rsquo;t tell them VMware Support give you a stock &amp;ldquo;You must have Domain Admins&amp;rdquo; reply to a support call. Solution Delegate the rights as per the following Microsoft KB Article https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/932455 &amp;hellip;yes I know it&amp;rsquo;s for 2003 but AD hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed that much since then&amp;hellip;shhh don&amp;rsquo;t tell!</description>

Firewall ports on the ESXi Host. I&amp;rsquo;m going to presume host and AD are on the same subnet, if not then you are responsible for checking routing and firewalls between Host and AD Domain Controllers are configure correctly Port 88 - Kerberos authentication
Port 123 – NTP

Like most of you reading this I get bugged by vCenter presuming this is my first Rodeo, as they say.
Everytime you go to a new Datacentre/Cluster/Folder/VM* (Delete as appropriate) it gives me the Getting Started pages.
So today I found the off switches:

      <description>VMware started as a Type 2 Hypervisor for doing a bit of lab/development testing on.
They&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since and even started chopping Windows out of the picture whenever possible. VCSA did a great job at removing not just vCenter but a number of the vSphere components like dump collector, log browser, syslog collector and auto deploy.
But to have a fully tidy and enterprise environment you needed certificates.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks now since I sat and passed the VCP-NV. Straight after the exam I went on holiday and on coming back I got straight back into work.
My background is working with VMware since Esx 2.x in 2005. In a more structured and career focussed way since 2011 when I did a great project to deploy 4 vBlocks with Linked vCenters. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on various virtualisation deployments, upgrades, support incidents (the joys of being on-call) and even a brief foray into setting up a Hyper-V environment for one customer!</description>

      <description>I was asked to look at an issue recently with bad IO performance on an SQL VM. SQLio tests were being run and the figures coming back were much lower than expected. There was a little bit of CPU Ready but only occasionally, and the environment was slightly overcommitted. However, after some quick investigation windows task manager showed that the iSCSI traffic was going over the Production Virtual NIC!?!?!
The VM had 2 NICs.</description>

      <description>I run my home lab on a PC running Windows 8.1 and VMware Workstation 10. The PC has an i7 with HT, 32GB RAM and an SSD.
I had to upgrade from Windows 7 as the Home Premium Edition only supported 16GB of RAM, which was irritating. I knew Windows 10 was coming but it&amp;rsquo;s End of July release date hadn&amp;rsquo;t been announced. So when it popped up offering me my &amp;ldquo;free upgrade&amp;rdquo; I accepted and am now dutifully waiting a couple of weeks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore any comments about DevOPs being a vague term like Cloud which means different things to different people.
To me it means trying to use tools and alternative project management approaches (Agile) to deliver repeatable things (applications/networks/virtual servers/physical servers) and continue to manage the configuration of those things after you&amp;rsquo;ve deployed them (not just running away).
At work I have recently started working more closely with our SDDC team there is plenty mention of a number of these tools and even the project management methodology of iteratively attempting small chunks of a project is new and interesting.</description>

      <description>In a recent change of tack to my learning plan I&amp;rsquo;ve moved from revising VCAP-DCA to VCP-NV. This has been driven by a need for work to be familiar with NSX and Multi-Hypervisor Virtualised Networking too.
I did a couple of the NSX Hands On Labs last October at VMworld but other than a few terms, and the fact some bits looked a lot like vShield from the vCloud Suite most of it had leaked out of my brain.</description>

Twitter is on fire with frantic retweeting and updates on what people are excited about on the VMware front. And there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to be excited about right now.
The biggest unsurprising but best bit is vSphere 6.0 goes GA. Now everyone can try long distance vmotion, VVols, 4vcpu Fault Tolerance, Instant Clone and more. Register for a trial and download below https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/evalcenter?p=vsphere6#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850</description>

A quick reinstall of windows and install of VMWorkstation and I had a great lab to revise for VCAP-DCA510 in a hurry. However I had promised myself that I&amp;rsquo;d set aside £120 this month to max out my motherboard with another 16Gb.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday I got the early train to Leeds stationed myself in a coffee shop and proceeded to stuff coffee and pastries into my mouth and last minute vSphere knowledge into my brain.
I had obtained a voucher to book the exam last year. However I&amp;rsquo;d been seconded to a &amp;ldquo;Business Transformation&amp;rdquo; project. Whilst this was quite interesting it did cause my technical skills to atrophy. To cut a long story short I rescheduled the exam a couple of times.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t used host profiles much in anger. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them used as first snapshots of host config, but rarely updated (naughty I know!).
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the midst of revising/labbing for my VCAP5-DCA. So I have my nested esxi lab environment running in workstation 10. All was going well until I tried to test out some VMware Update Manager tasks. I had installed VUM on a 2k3 VM running on one of my esxi hosts (I may break it out to run in workstation when I have more memory).</description>

I know Josh Andrews offered up &amp;ldquo;create 100 powered off VMs with a certain config or clones of an existing template&amp;rdquo; which is good but not something I&amp;rsquo;d normally do in my role. Then one came to me. So here it is

      <description>Everyone&amp;rsquo;s got one, and like petrolheads showing off their v8 or GTI here&amp;rsquo;s my vSphere homelab.
Originally it was just an HP Microserver accessed via a pc running virtualised esxi hosts.
But I needed to upgrade my main PC and I still had a VMWorkstation 10 license from my VCP5 in June to use up.
So I went for a Core i7 4770s. It&amp;rsquo;s quad core with HT so 8 threads for VMs to consume.</description>

      <description>Like many I&amp;rsquo;m currently cramming for my VCAP-DCA.
The reason behind the cramming is that it&amp;rsquo;s on the 15th Jan and it&amp;rsquo;s DCA510 which has been retired so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t push it back despite not getting the voucher long ago or starting studying long ago enough.
That&amp;rsquo;s my excuses out of the way early.
So I could write my own blog posts breaking down the blueprint. Well that is useful to me, being able to explain something to a level where someone else can understand it is a good demonstration of your knowledge of something usually&amp;hellip;.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s day 3 of vmworld for me and NSX is big. The keynotes feature it heavily, it&amp;rsquo;s great new technology and the queues for standby to the breakout sessions where NSX is in the title are like queues for a new iPhone release.
So it took me this long to stop and say, wait! What is this north south east west stuff? Everyone refers to it to talk about traffic in data centres but no one has defined it.</description>

      <description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.
After a couple of hours spent building MetalBeard out of Lego I remembered and read it.
&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description>

      <description>I was asked to look at an issue on a customer account where when a server VM, used as a XenApp Dynamic Desktop server is moved from Computers OU to the desired destination OU and gpupdate run then suddenly the D and E drives were inaccessible. They could be seen in &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo; and also in &amp;ldquo;Disk Management&amp;rdquo; but only listed as NTFS and no used/free space in My Computer, despite me having admin rights.</description>

VMware authorisation Pearson Vue confirmation and now A voucher (for the $$$ bit) from my lovely employer :-) Well ok the last bit has been all rubber stamped and approved but it&#39;s somewhere in our suppliers system to churn a handle to actual give me a code....anyway that&#39;s an aside, as soon as it comes through I&#39;ll be booking the exam on pearson giving myself 3months/12weeks to prep.</description>

      <description>Another of the outputs of our recent penetration test was an issue with Weak Ciphers in both the IPMI service on C200 Rack servers and B220 M3 blades and the CIMC https server of the C200&amp;rsquo;s
Ok so can we fix it?
Well the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t a black/white yes or no.
We are running the above UCS servers in 2 vBlocks. The first is a vBlock 100 the second is a vBlock 300.</description>

      <description>We had a Pen Test done recently on a couple of vBlocks that we need some security accreditation against. (See how I&#39;m being vague there for security reasons ;-)
One of the items that came up was a weak cipher on port 10109 of the vCenter server.
Zut Alors! That sounds serious, well it might be.
Not seeing a way to update the service which was opening this port (vCenter Inventory Service) I did what we would all do, which was search for the KB article.</description>

      <description>I sat my VCP5-DCV last Monday (a week ago Monday now) and passed. 450/500 so I am quite chuffed.
It was a great relief as I had devoted lots of lunchtimes and evenings and late nights into silly times in the morning to it.
I was so relieved that I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged or done anything out of work since!
I resumed things like going to the gym at lunch times (VCP5=Fat Nealo!</description>

      <description>During a recent patching cycle VMtools across a set of VMs were updated to the latest version. This was to patch security vulnerabilities in the versions which were running to ensure the environment was as secure as possible for a PenTest which would go towards IL3 Accreditation.
Shavlik was good enough to oblige here and went out and patched lots of VMs with new VMtools automatically to the latest version.</description>

      <description>Whilst searching around I spotted an app is never used from VMware in the Play store.
It&amp;rsquo;s called Watchlist and it gives you simple monitoring and visibility of selected Hosts and VMs that you choose from your standalone host or vCenter instance. You can easily view their statuses:
And see the console of a VM, see what resources it is using and also stop/start/reset it.
I just restarted one of my virtual hosts and watched it boot in the console.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my little HP Microserver and it&amp;rsquo;s a beauty. However I do have to keep powering it on and then connecting with vi client to the host then powering on the VC Appliance, then the virtual ESXi hosts, you know the drill&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
So how to get them to autostart. Well it&amp;rsquo;s a simple option and to my mind it looks like a mix of a vApp and HA :-)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revising for a good few weeks now.
Setting up my homelab, being wowed by autodeploy installations and practising other things I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much exposure to in my day to day vSphere 5 usage. However I still had to cover those niggly bits that come under the heading:
&amp;ldquo;Never used this, probably never will, don&amp;rsquo;t understand it!&amp;rdquo;
NPIV was one of these. You&amp;rsquo;ll all have seen the questions if you&amp;rsquo;re preparing for the exam, or more often wonder why it&amp;rsquo;s there squirreled away on the options tab of a VMs configuration page.</description>

      <description>I first commented on the VMware communities forums back in 2006 on an ESX 2.x related issue someone was having. I had a 7 years hiatus from 2007 to now :-)
I decided to start trawling the forums to answer people&amp;rsquo;s questions as part of my VCP5.
What? I hear you say. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that eating up into valuable revision time? Well I don&amp;rsquo;t think so and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
I use forums, and Google.</description>

      <description>Very very brief one this, but it had me foxed for 5 minutes and time is precious!
I was looking into Distributed Virtual Switches and reading up on Port Bindings. I wanted to see what the options were (kinaesthetic learner me!)
Opened up my DVS in the vSphere client and right click, edit settings, and voila&amp;hellip;..!?
Erm the option is not there.
After checking the vSphere Docs online [embed]https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc%2FGUID-69933F6E-2442-46CF-AA17-1196CB9A0A09.html[/embed] I spotted the obvious.</description>

      <description>After being an evangelist last week I&amp;rsquo;m now converting my Auto-Deploy ESXi hosts into Stateful installs and therefore ditching their wonderful ephemeralness!
Why? Well for the purpose of a small lab which I will have to rebuild at some point I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to configure the supporting architecture which would mainly be the host profiles and dhcp/pxe environment.
Also it&amp;rsquo;s another option and part of using Auto-Deploy. You can choose to apply a host-profile, once the machine has first booted into ESXi which will then write the install to disk.</description>

      <description>I was setting up a small environment in a DMZ to be used to pull in patches for VMware UMDS, Shavlik (windows OS) and Redhat.
Now just the act of &amp;ldquo;connecting the utility to the internet via the proxy&amp;rdquo; is what I&amp;rsquo;m focussing on.
In Shavlik there is a box in the gui to enter the proxy authentication username and password
In UMDS you specify the credentials during setup/installation (you can also easily edit xml after install if you forget)</description>

      <description>I had a design/suggested infrastructure set up on a recent project which basically had UMDS on a server in a DMZ getting ESXi patches from the internet via a proxy. Then a server in a secondary DMZ outside one of the target environments running another UMDS instance.
The idea was to open 80/443 from UMDS in one DMZ to the other. Adding the internet connected UMDS server as a url to the secondary UMDS server.</description>

      <description>Revision. It means to review (previously studied materials) according to dictionary.com
However as anyone who has ever studied for a tech exam knows it is usually the complete opposite! You know what you know. You work with it and click those options every day. BUT you know that the exam covers all the things you never use, some you may have never even looked at.

      <description>So when last we spoke I had left Linux updating.
It was when I came to resume last night that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down the original article I had been following.
It was only when I found Marco Broeken&amp;rsquo;s blog &amp;ldquo;vSphere5 Auto-Deploy in 20 Steps&amp;rdquo;. This started straight away with the, now, blindingly obvious statement that the VCVA is a Linux box, therefore my Ubuntu box was a waste of space.</description>

Well no such luck. I powered on my Microserver host and the vCenter appliance fired up with it automatically. Nice!

      <description>So you deploy the VCA from the OVA. Easy peasy. Any monkey could do that!
You config it from the webpage. Things like changing the default password, general good practice etc.
&amp;hellip;.and obviously you change the IP to a static one.
Wait! Stop! You just broke the VCA. Well you sort of did. You changed the name but didn&amp;rsquo;t update the SSL cert that was generated when it was first built/configured.</description>

      <description>I passed my VCP4 way back in 2011. Shortly after (very shortly!) those pesky developers released vSphere5. VMware generously allowed VCP4&amp;rsquo;s to upgrade by the end of Feb 2012. Whilst that was generous, at the time my brain was frazzled from VCP4 study, I&amp;rsquo;d only just really got stuck in to vSphere4 deployments and wanted to get hands-on v5 experience before I sat the VCP5 exam.
Time passed. VCP split into VCP-DCV, VCP-Cloud, VCP-DT.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 37, work at a global IT services company with big customers. When I started in 2005 my first project was helping deploy 10s of ESX hosts. Yes &amp;ldquo;ESX&amp;rdquo; v2.5 &amp;ldquo;Virtual Infrastructure&amp;rdquo; hosts and Virtual Center 1.something or other. It&amp;rsquo;s 9 years ago now but we had multiple farms of 7 hosts (I think) which had shared LUNs, and all ran training courses. Each training course was 6 VMs. Only 1 was unique as a citrix presentation server v4 front-end.</description>

      <description>This one should hopefully be short :-)
I have: HP N40L Microserver. If you&amp;rsquo;ve looked into a good cheap box to run ESXi on then you have surely come across this server or one of it&amp;rsquo;s more recent sped up relatives. Here are the quick specs It came slightly underspecced with only 2GB. That was quickly upped to 8GB. It can run 4-6 VMs comfortably depending on what spec you want to give them and how heavily they are utilised.</description>

      <description>I recently had a request to provide some instructions for newly transitioned users on Windows 7 on &amp;ldquo;Where is it in Windows 7 compared to XP&amp;rdquo;. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lots of posts from people asking for install media etc. for XP. Now whilst this isn&amp;rsquo;t a solution for that explicitly it does give you an XP environment to test in.
If you are lucky enough to have Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise/Ultimate. Then you can simply enable &amp;ldquo;Windows XP Mode&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Perhaps I should put it down to it being a Friday, like the inverse of a Monday instead of lots of things breaking, things just didn&#39;t seem to be working. I had built a Windows 2008 server from a custom SOE disc, all seemed well but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t register in DNS. I&amp;rsquo;d specified the name servers correctly and the server I&amp;rsquo;d built the week before had no issues registering in the same domain.</description>

      <title>VTSP - VMWare Certification and Accreditation...not mutually exclusive!</title>

      <description>Morning all,
I sat my VCP4 a couple of weeks ago and managed to pass. It&amp;rsquo;s a tough exam and requires you to know about all aspects of VMWare&amp;rsquo;s offerings (but all detailed in the exam blueprint pdf!)
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you tips here as Scott Vessey&amp;rsquo;s blog invented that wheel and keeps it well maintained http://vmwaretraining.blogspot.com/ However through my company I did find out something interesting.
As we are a VMWare partner (and many of you who are working toward VCP are likely to be too, check with your manager or VMWare account manager) then you may have access to the VMWare Partner University.</description>

      <title>The evils of snapshots!</title>

      <description>Been away from tech-blogging for a while now for a number of reasons, not least studying for vcp4.
On the way something came up at work which needed another blog post about it, despite many others doing the same!
Deleting snapshots, big ones especially, times out at 95% on VI3 VCenter 2 leaving you all panicked and squeaky bum time.
The simple summary is that coalescing a 200gb snap could take up to 6hrs :-( so be patient.</description>

      <title>Sync/Backups - There is such a thing as a free lunch! (SyncToy)</title>

      <description>I wrote a brief post previously about online sync providers and storage. Following on from that I wanted to get my own house in order, quite literally. I have a beefy desktop, a HTPC (but with only 90gb ssd) and a laptop from my employer.
As with most of you I imagine your work laptop has accumulated plenty of your personal stuff. I also expect if you have more than one pc at home (not forgetting phones and/or tablets) that your pics/videos and mp3s rapidly become distributed and a pain to manage.</description>

      <title>ESXi Whitebox Configuration</title>

      <description>After a few evenings of fumbling, finally success!
For those who are interested the config is.
GA-P35C-DS3R (Rev 2.0) Motherboard Intel E6550 Core2Duo 2.33GHz 4 GB OCZ DDR2 PC2-8500 REAPER HPC EDITION Gigabyte 9600GT Passively Cooled LG BH08LS20 Blu-Ray RW Drive
That is simply ESXi installed. No storage configured yet (still pontificating there) and no VMs&amp;hellip;more posts to fllow, but I do like the colour scheme :-)</description>

      <description>If you make a Bootable Linux USB and receive the following error
No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found! boot:
Then simply go back and format your USB as FAT not FAT32, then recopy/re-install your Distro onto the USB stick. Problem Solved.</description>

      <title>Supply and Demand : The Crazy Price of NICs</title>

      <description>Ok, so I want to have my own ESXi host at home. Initially it may sound like a tall order but there are lots of good community sites out there describing how to do it and what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
www.vm-help.com has a very good HWCL on it compiled from user experience. So after trying and failing to install ESXi 4.1 I found on vm-help that my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s on-board NIC isn&amp;rsquo;t compatible as there are no drivers on the installation CD for it.</description>

      <description>Like most people I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a good way to freeload, legally!
Fortunately there are plenty of charitable developers and organisations out there writing software to accommodate us, the leeching public. So here&amp;rsquo;s my list:
Windows=Linux Do you have a legal OS? Even if your PC came with XP on it from the manufacturer did you get a legit upgrade to Vista or Windows 7? I&amp;rsquo;ll let you answer that, but if the answer is no then Linux can save you £80+ I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to offer a suggestion as to which version, or distribution as they are called, to use here as it will be set upon by an army of zealots all giving me reasons why my suggestion is twaddle and their chosen &amp;ldquo;distro&amp;rdquo; is the best.</description>
