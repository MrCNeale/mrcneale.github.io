      <description>This first post is to run through common issues that are simple and &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo; to presume the end-user/sysadmin has checked first
Firewall ports on the ESXi Host. I&amp;rsquo;m going to presume host and AD are on the same subnet, if not then you are responsible for checking routing and firewalls between Host and AD Domain Controllers are configure correctly Port 88 - Kerberos authentication
Port 123 – NTP
Port 135 - RPC</description>

      <description>During a recent patching cycle VMtools across a set of VMs were updated to the latest version. This was to patch security vulnerabilities in the versions which were running to ensure the environment was as secure as possible for a PenTest which would go towards IL3 Accreditation.
Shavlik was good enough to oblige here and went out and patched lots of VMs with new VMtools automatically to the latest version.</description>
