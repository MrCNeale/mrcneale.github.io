      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore any comments about DevOPs being a vague term like Cloud which means different things to different people.
To me it means trying to use tools and alternative project management approaches (Agile) to deliver repeatableÂ things (applications/networks/virtual servers/physical servers) and continue to manage the configuration of those things after you&amp;rsquo;ve deployed them (not just running away).
At work I have recently started working more closely with our SDDC team there is plenty mention of a number of these tools and even the project management methodology of iteratively attempting small chunks of a project is new and interesting.</description>
