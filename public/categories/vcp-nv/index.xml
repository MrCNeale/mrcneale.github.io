      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks now since I sat and passed the VCP-NV. Straight after the exam I went on holiday and on coming back I got straight back into work.
My background is working with VMware since Esx 2.x in 2005. In a more structured and career focussed way since 2011 when I did a great project to deploy 4 vBlocks with Linked vCenters. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on various virtualisation deployments, upgrades, support incidents (the joys of being on-call) and even a brief foray into setting up a Hyper-V environment for one customer!</description>

      <description>In a recent change of tack to my learning plan I&amp;rsquo;ve moved from revising VCAP-DCA to VCP-NV.Â This has been driven by a need for work to be familiar with NSX and Multi-Hypervisor Virtualised Networking too.
I did a couple of the NSX Hands On Labs last October at VMworld but other than a few terms, and the fact some bits looked a lot like vShield from the vCloud Suite most of it had leaked out of my brain.</description>
