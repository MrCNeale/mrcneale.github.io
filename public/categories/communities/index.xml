      <description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.

&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description>
