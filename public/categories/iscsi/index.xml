      <description>I was asked to look at an issue recently with bad IO performance on an SQL VM. SQLio tests were being run and the figures coming back were much lower than expected. There was a little bit of CPU Ready but only occasionally, and the environment was slightly overcommitted. However, after some quick investigation windows task manager showed that the iSCSI traffic was going over the Production Virtual NIC!?!?!
The VM had 2 NICs.</description>
