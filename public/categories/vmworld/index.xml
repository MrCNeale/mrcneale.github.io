      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve filled up my schedule, I&amp;rsquo;ve Favourited sessions that were full so I can check the standby queues out and here&amp;rsquo;s a few other things I want to tick off this time round at VMworld
Surf the hall more. Last year I waited until the Thursday but had some great talks with folks at Simplivity, Pernixdata and others...don&#39;t know why I was so shy but this time I&#39;m going to be asking lots of questions.</description>

      <description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.
After a couple of hours spent building MetalBeard out of Lego I remembered and read it.
&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description>
