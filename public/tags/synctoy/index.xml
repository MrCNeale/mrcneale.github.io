      <description>I wrote a brief post previously about online sync providers and storage. Following on from that I wanted to get my own house in order, quite literally. I have a beefy desktop, a HTPC (but with only 90gb ssd) and a laptop from my employer.
As with most of you I imagine your work laptop has accumulated plenty of your personal stuff. I also expect if you have more than one pc at home (not forgetting phones and/or tablets) that your pics/videos and mp3s rapidly become distributed and a pain to manage.</description>
