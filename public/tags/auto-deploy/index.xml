      <description>After being an evangelist last week I&amp;rsquo;m now converting my Auto-Deploy ESXi hosts into Stateful installs and therefore ditching their wonderful ephemeralness!
Why? Well for the purpose of a small lab which I will have to rebuild at some point I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to configure the supporting architecture which would mainly be the host profiles and dhcp/pxe environment.
Also it&amp;rsquo;s another option and part of using Auto-Deploy. You can choose to apply a host-profile, once the machine has first booted into ESXi which will then write the install to disk.</description>

      <description>Revision. It means to review (previously studied materials) according to dictionary.com
However as anyone who has ever studied for a tech exam knows it is usually the complete opposite! You know what you know. You work with it and click those options every day. BUT you know that the exam covers all the things you never use, some you may have never even looked at.
