      <description>This one should hopefully be short :-)
I have: HP N40L Microserver. If you&amp;rsquo;ve looked into a good cheap box to run ESXi on then you have surely come across this server or one of it&amp;rsquo;s more recent sped up relatives. Here are the quick specs It came slightly underspecced with only 2GB. That was quickly upped to 8GB. It can run 4-6 VMs comfortably depending on what spec you want to give them and how heavily they are utilised.</description>

      <description>After a few evenings of fumbling, finally success!
For those who are interested the config is.
GA-P35C-DS3R (Rev 2.0) Motherboard Intel E6550 Core2Duo 2.33GHz 4 GBÂ OCZ DDR2 PC2-8500 REAPER HPC EDITION Gigabyte 9600GT Passively Cooled LG BH08LS20 Blu-Ray RW Drive
That is simply ESXi installed. No storage configured yet (still pontificating there) and no VMs&amp;hellip;more posts to fllow, but I do like the colour scheme :-)</description>

      <description>Ok, so I want to have my own ESXi host at home. Initially it may sound like a tall order but there are lots of good community sites out there describing how to do it and what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
www.vm-help.com has a very good HWCL on it compiled from user experience. So after trying and failing to install ESXi 4.1 I found on vm-help that my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s on-board NIC isn&amp;rsquo;t compatible as there are no drivers on the installation CD for it.</description>
