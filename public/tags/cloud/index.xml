      <description>Networking traffic described as points of the compass.
It&amp;rsquo;s day 3 of vmworld for me and NSX is big. The keynotes feature it heavily, it&amp;rsquo;s great new technology and the queues for standby to the breakout sessions where NSX is in the title are like queues for a new iPhone release.
So it took me this long to stop and say, wait! What is this north south east west stuff? Everyone refers to it to talk about traffic in data centres but no one has defined it.</description>

      <description>I personally go with Dropbox as I find the client to be small and pretty unobtrusive. But I&amp;rsquo;ve not used the others intensively. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to have a try and there is 21GB or more to play with!</description>
