      <description>The Broadest Blueprint yet - In Depth I sat the AZ-500 exam last week. I had set aside some time for study, arranged an exam voucher through work, booked it. All set. I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-103 exam at the end of July, blog post is a little late due to some family stuff, but back on it now. I missed the deadline to do the transition exam, but that wasn&#39;t a big problem as they had replaced the previous requirement of two exams to get Azure Administrator (AZ-100 + AZ-101) down to just one in AZ-103 This exam felt very familiar.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-302 exam on Tuesday. It has been updated since the Beta considerably. Many who took the beta felt that it wasn&#39;t Architect focussed but more developer focussed. Now whilst in this new brave cloud world you have to be part Admin/Pre-Sales/Architect and Developer, writing C# or node.js code in an Architect Exam didn&#39;t seem fair to me either.</description>

      <description>An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the 70-533 exam last Wednesday. It was the version after the Jan 2018 updates. That last bit is critical. Cloud moves fast and Microsoft published the exam 4 years ago. It was originally based around ASM, the white and blue GUI and a different set of PowerShell commands. It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.</description>

      <description>Last month I sat and passed the VCIX-NV exam. Driven, like a lot of others, by the impending retirement of the exam that keeps getting extended...more on that later. This is a post in two parts, first the exam experience, second a few pondering on VMware Education&amp;rsquo;s current trajectory.
The Day Itself Here in the UK there are only 3, I believe, VCAP accredited test centres. I hopped on a train across to Leeds, that ended up being delayed and I only had time for a coffee and sandiwch before having to get started.</description>

      <title>Upgrading your HomeLab to Windows 10 &#43; VMware Workstation ??</title>

      <description>I run my home lab on a PC running Windows 8.1 and VMware Workstation 10. The PC has an i7 with HT, 32GB RAM and an SSD.
I had to upgrade from Windows 7 as the Home Premium Edition only supported 16GB of RAM, which was irritating. I knew Windows 10 was coming but it&amp;rsquo;s End of July release date hadn&amp;rsquo;t been announced. So when it popped up offering me my &amp;ldquo;free upgrade&amp;rdquo; I accepted and am now dutifully waiting a couple of weeks.</description>

      <description>Like many I&amp;rsquo;m currently cramming for my VCAP-DCA.
The reason behind the cramming is that it&amp;rsquo;s on the 15th Jan and it&amp;rsquo;s DCA510 which has been retired so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t push it back despite not getting the voucher long ago or starting studying long ago enough.
That&amp;rsquo;s my excuses out of the way early.
So I could write my own blog posts breaking down the blueprint. Well that is useful to me, being able to explain something to a level where someone else can understand it is a good demonstration of your knowledge of something usually&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>After passing my VCP, and subsequently falling back into the bad habit of not studying! I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get the
VMware authorisation Pearson Vue confirmation and now A voucher (for the $$$ bit) from my lovely employer :-) Well ok the last bit has been all rubber stamped and approved but it&#39;s somewhere in our suppliers system to churn a handle to actual give me a code....anyway that&#39;s an aside, as soon as it comes through I&#39;ll be booking the exam on pearson giving myself 3months/12weeks to prep.</description>

      <description>Revision. It means to review (previously studied materials) according to dictionary.com
However as anyone who has ever studied for a tech exam knows it is usually the complete opposite! You know what you know. You work with it and click those options every day. BUT you know that the exam covers all the things you never use, some you may have never even looked at.

      <description>So when last we spoke I had left Linux updating.
It was when I came to resume last night that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down the original article I had been following.
It was only when I found Marco Broeken&amp;rsquo;s blog &amp;ldquo;vSphere5 Auto-Deploy in 20 Steps&amp;rdquo;. This started straight away with the, now, blindingly obvious statement that the VCVA is a Linux box, therefore my Ubuntu box was a waste of space.</description>

      <description>So tonight&amp;rsquo;s revision was meant to be pretty quick. It is Game Of Thrones night after all!
Well no such luck. I powered on my Microserver host and the vCenter appliance fired up with it automatically. Nice!
Logged on to the web client and the fat client. I have been trying to alternate between the two to make sure I can spot any differences, or things you can&amp;rsquo;t do in one but can in the other.</description>

      <title>VCP5 - Fixing SSL Cert on newly deployed vCenter Server Appliance after changing IP</title>

      <description>So you deploy the VCA from the OVA. Easy peasy. Any monkey could do that!
You config it from the webpage. Things like changing the default password, general good practice etc.
&amp;hellip;.and obviously you change the IP to a static one.
Wait! Stop! You just broke the VCA. Well you sort of did. You changed the name but didn&amp;rsquo;t update the SSL cert that was generated when it was first built/configured.</description>

      <description>I passed my VCP4 way back in 2011. Shortly after (very shortly!) those pesky developers released vSphere5. VMware generously allowed VCP4&amp;rsquo;s to upgrade by the end of Feb 2012. Whilst that was generous, at the time my brain was frazzled from VCP4 study, I&amp;rsquo;d only just really got stuck in to vSphere4 deployments and wanted to get hands-on v5 experience before I sat the VCP5 exam.
Time passed. VCP split into VCP-DCV, VCP-Cloud, VCP-DT.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 37, work at a global IT services company with big customers. When I started in 2005 my first project was helping deploy 10s of ESX hosts. Yes &amp;ldquo;ESX&amp;rdquo; v2.5 &amp;ldquo;Virtual Infrastructure&amp;rdquo; hosts and Virtual Center 1.something or other. It&amp;rsquo;s 9 years ago now but we had multiple farms of 7 hosts (I think) which had shared LUNs, and all ran training courses. Each training course was 6 VMs. Only 1 was unique as a citrix presentation server v4 front-end.</description>
