      <title>How to Troubleshoot Azure Self-Hosted Devops Agent issues</title>
      <link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2022-09-05-devopsagenttroubleshooting/</link>

      <description>Why Use Self-Hosted Agents for Devops jobs? We recently had issues with some Devops tasks queuing. This was happening only with the tasks in the job that we run on our self-hosted agents.
Why run our own agents? It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable question. Microsoft provide agents (VMs) pre-configured and ready to run your tasks for you, so why mess about setting up your own?
There is usually a problem or configuration that cannot be solved using the Microsoft Pool of agents as they are selected at random and the only known quantity about them is that they will be selected from a pool that is in the same region as your DevOps Organisation.</description>

      <title>Powershell to retreive Alerts which use a specific Action Group</title>

      <description>&#34;Is this Action Group used by any alerts?&#34; If you want to find out if an Action Group is used by any alerts (metric or Log) how do you do it? Two simple queries help here:
To check if any Metric alerts point to your Action Group, run
Get-AzMetricAlertRuleV2 | ?{$_.actions.ActionGroupId -like &amp;#39;YourActionGroupName&amp;#39;} To check if any Log Alerts (Known as Scheduled Query alerts since classic was retired) run</description>

      <title>Powershell to retreive Azure VM Memory Size</title>
      <link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-04-27-powershell-to-retreive-azure-vm-memory-size/</link>

      <guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-04-27-powershell-to-retreive-azure-vm-memory-size/</guid>
      <description>&#34;How much memory do my VMs have?&#34; It seems like an obvious thing to ask. It seems reasonable to me....However without additional tooling, such as inventory or configuration management software, you can&#39;t easily get a list of Azure VMs and their memory sizes that you can manipulate. If you just run &#34;get-azvm&#34; then it returns a property of the vm which is a &#34;HardwareProfile&#34;. This just has a sub property of the VM t-shirt size.</description>

      <description>The Broadest Blueprint yet - In Depth I sat the AZ-500 exam last week. I had set aside some time for study, arranged an exam voucher through work, booked it. All set. I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.</description>

      <description>When is a Culture a Module? Including pre-req checks in your code is good practice&amp;hellip;.so you add it in.
In our Powershell scripts which require Azure Powershell cmdlets we have moved, as should anyone keeping abreast of releases, to Powershell Core.
But our checks to see if the Az Module is installed were giving mixed results.
Even though the commands all worked, Get-AzVM etc. the module check for &amp;ldquo;Az&amp;rdquo; returned nothing, blank, nada.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-103 exam at the end of July, blog post is a little late due to some family stuff, but back on it now. I missed the deadline to do the transition exam, but that wasn&#39;t a big problem as they had replaced the previous requirement of two exams to get Azure Administrator (AZ-100 + AZ-101) down to just one in AZ-103 This exam felt very familiar.</description>

      <description>Practical user for Docker/Containers in infra as code (IaC) - a standard deployment environment &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code, Automate all the things, Containers are the future, DevOPs to the max!&amp;rdquo; has been a chorus of lots of people in tech for a while and as a non-app dev I never really saw applications for containers to help what I do.
What do you do? Good question. Well it involves a lot of ARM template deployments and deploying blueprints and standard environments to run tests against.</description>

      <description>What can you do to find out more about why a VM extension is failing or not working quite right? Azure VMs are great and VM extensions are even better. Either a Vendor, or you, can create some code to do a thing to a VM. Usually install software or agents and configure it. Most common for the average user will be things like the Log Analytics Agent Extension and the Custom Script Extension (where you can run your own Powershell or Bash post install).</description>

      <title>Azure Instance Metadata Service Usage Examples</title>

      <description>What does Azure have that VMware never had? AKA What is the Azure Instance Metadata Service? There&amp;rsquo;s probably a ton of answers here. But the one I was angling for is &amp;ldquo;Which vCenter is my VM running on?&amp;rdquo;
Who&amp;rsquo;d be crazy enough to lose a VM? Well you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised in enterprise estates that have been running for 10 years and Sue who managed the VM farm just retired and moved to Cypus so you can&amp;rsquo;t get hold of her to ask&amp;hellip; Anyway, what I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about it more useful than just finding out where your VM is if you (or your script/code) only has access inside the VM.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-302 exam on Tuesday. It has been updated since the Beta considerably. Many who took the beta felt that it wasn&#39;t Architect focussed but more developer focussed. Now whilst in this new brave cloud world you have to be part Admin/Pre-Sales/Architect and Developer, writing C# or node.js code in an Architect Exam didn&#39;t seem fair to me either.</description>

      <description>We use Log Analytics to collect logs so that we can query the pooled logs to generate alerts. A common scenario. We had an ARM template that had worked for a long time, but when we had an issue, the first thing Microsoft said was &amp;ldquo;Why are you using such an old version?&amp;rdquo; Ok, we&amp;rsquo;d missed the agent updates on this particular template for Linux, it&amp;rsquo;s always best to be up to date.</description>

Pre-reqs You&amp;rsquo;ll need:
Read/do Part 1 (https://www.chrisneale.org/Azure-Lab-via-Templates-Part1/) Read/do Part 2 (https://www.chrisneale.org/Azure-Lab-via-Templates-Part2/) Be a really quick catcher upper The Story so far and next So you have an ARM template in your library.

Pre-reqs You&amp;rsquo;ll need:
Read/do Part 1 (https://www.chrisneale.org/Azure-Lab-via-Templates-Part1/) The Story so far and next We had an ARM template that would deploy a single vNet with a single subnet with fixed names.
Now we&amp;rsquo;ll add a VM&amp;hellip;..but first we need to add one more thing a NIC</description>

      <description>Aim This post will show you how the format of ARM templates and how to deploy the simplest one without parameters or variables via the Portal, Powershell, AZ CLI.
Pre-reqs You&amp;rsquo;ll need:
An Azure account The latest Azure Powershell. Install instructions can be found here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-6.10.0) Your preferred Code Editor, I mostly use Notepad++ ARM Template Format As you&amp;rsquo;ll see shortly the format of an ARM template is relatively simple.</description>

      <description>An Odd Request This implementation started from a SAP team who said they wanted to replicate, in Azure, the AWS Internet Gateway functionality. In particular the option for all outbound traffic from VMs to route via a single outbound IP. As you may know even if your default Azure VM does not have a Public IP assigned to it, it can still access the internet for things like windows updates etc.</description>

      <description>An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the 70-533 exam last Wednesday. It was the version after the Jan 2018 updates. That last bit is critical. Cloud moves fast and Microsoft published the exam 4 years ago. It was originally based around ASM, the white and blue GUI and a different set of PowerShell commands. It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.</description>

      <title>Gotcha when importing client certificates for Azure P2S VPN</title>

      <description>After waiting 30 minutes for my P2S VPN gateway to deploy in Azure I was obviously eager to get VPN-ing, who wouldn&#39;t be! I ran through the instructions to generate a self-signed Root Cert and a client cert from Microsoft on this page [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site) \*(Put a pin here, we&#39;ll come back to this) I&#39;d imported the certs to my test client VM and the Client VPN setup exe ran ok and created a connection in &#34;</description>
