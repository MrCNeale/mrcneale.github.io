      <description>I sat my VCP5-DCV last Monday (a week ago Monday now) and passed. 450/500 so I am quite chuffed.
It was a great relief as I had devoted lots of lunchtimes and evenings and late nights into silly times in the morning to it.
I was so relieved that I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged or done anything out of work since!
I resumed things like going to the gym at lunch times (VCP5=Fat Nealo!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my little HP Microserver and it&amp;rsquo;s a beauty. However I do have to keep powering it on and then connecting with vi client to the host then powering on the VC Appliance, then the virtual ESXi hosts, you know the drill&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
So how to get them to autostart. Well it&amp;rsquo;s a simple option and to my mind it looks like a mix of a vApp and HA :-)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revising for a good few weeks now.
Setting up my homelab, being wowed by autodeploy installations and practising other things I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much exposure to in my day to day vSphere 5 usage. However I still had to cover those niggly bits that come under the heading:
&amp;ldquo;Never used this, probably never will, don&amp;rsquo;t understand it!&amp;rdquo;
NPIV was one of these. You&amp;rsquo;ll all have seen the questions if you&amp;rsquo;re preparing for the exam, or more often wonder why it&amp;rsquo;s there squirreled away on the options tab of a VMs configuration page.</description>

      <description>I first commented on the VMware communities forums back in 2006 on an ESX 2.x related issue someone was having. I had a 7 years hiatus from 2007 to now :-)
I decided to start trawling the forums to answer people&amp;rsquo;s questions as part of my VCP5.
What? I hear you say. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that eating up into valuable revision time? Well I don&amp;rsquo;t think so and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
I use forums, and Google.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 37, work at a global IT services company with big customers. When I started in 2005 my first project was helping deploy 10s of ESX hosts. Yes &amp;ldquo;ESX&amp;rdquo; v2.5 &amp;ldquo;Virtual Infrastructure&amp;rdquo; hosts and Virtual Center 1.something or other. It&amp;rsquo;s 9 years ago now but we had multiple farms of 7 hosts (I think) which had shared LUNs, and all ran training courses. Each training course was 6 VMs. Only 1 was unique as a citrix presentation server v4 front-end.</description>
