      <description>I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.
It was watching these that reenforced my understanding that this was possibly the broadest area of Azure. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that security affects all things.
With the popularity of DevOPs and now DevSecOPs, we should all know that &amp;ldquo;Security should be baked in from the start&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This exam felt very familiar. The questions were not vastly changed from 70-533 which I sat last year, and the format was the same as AZ-302 in that the exam is divided into sections:
Traditional Multiple choice Scenario based multiple choice, where the same scenario will be offered for many questions and different solutions proposed. You have to answer if the proposed solution will meet the requirements Labs. Where you actually log in to an Azure Portal and do things.</description>

      <description>Practical user for Docker/Containers in infra as code (IaC) - a standard deployment environment &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code, Automate all the things, Containers are the future, DevOPs to the max!&amp;rdquo; has been a chorus of lots of people in tech for a while and as a non-app dev I never really saw applications for containers to help what I do.
What do you do? Good question. Well it involves a lot of ARM template deployments and deploying blueprints and standard environments to run tests against.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting Azure VM Extension Installation Failures</title>

      <description>What can you do to find out more about why a VM extension is failing or not working quite right? Azure VMs are great and VM extensions are even better. Either a Vendor, or you, can create some code to do a thing to a VM. Usually install software or agents and configure it. Most common for the average user will be things like the Log Analytics Agent Extension and the Custom Script Extension (where you can run your own Powershell or Bash post install).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s also due to retire at the end of June, so if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this now&amp;hellip;GET STUDYING! :-)
As usual the IaaS sections and IAM/AD/Security areas, which I have most background in were quite simple to absorb. Where I had to pay much more attention is around the PaaS/Serverless application space. So Web Apps, Functions, Batch, Event Grids etc.
This may be different for you, but where I am currently we&amp;rsquo;re still helping a lot of customers move from on-prem into cloud, so they haven&amp;rsquo;t expanded or transformed to start using PaaS services heavily.</description>

      <description>It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.
Initially that had me concerned as I came to Azure 12 months ago fresh onto ARM. It was new at first but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any ASM baggage. I saw the exam still had lots of ASM content when I looked into it last summer. But there have been TWO updates to the exam since then.</description>
