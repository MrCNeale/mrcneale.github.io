      <description>The Broadest Blueprint yet - In Depth I sat the AZ-500 exam last week. I had set aside some time for study, arranged an exam voucher through work, booked it. All set. I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-103 exam at the end of July, blog post is a little late due to some family stuff, but back on it now. I missed the deadline to do the transition exam, but that wasn&#39;t a big problem as they had replaced the previous requirement of two exams to get Azure Administrator (AZ-100 + AZ-101) down to just one in AZ-103 This exam felt very familiar.</description>

      <description>Practical user for Docker/Containers in infra as code (IaC) - a standard deployment environment &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code, Automate all the things, Containers are the future, DevOPs to the max!&amp;rdquo; has been a chorus of lots of people in tech for a while and as a non-app dev I never really saw applications for containers to help what I do.
What do you do? Good question. Well it involves a lot of ARM template deployments and deploying blueprints and standard environments to run tests against.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting Azure VM Extension Installation Failures</title>

      <description>What can you do to find out more about why a VM extension is failing or not working quite right? Azure VMs are great and VM extensions are even better. Either a Vendor, or you, can create some code to do a thing to a VM. Usually install software or agents and configure it. Most common for the average user will be things like the Log Analytics Agent Extension and the Custom Script Extension (where you can run your own Powershell or Bash post install).</description>

      <description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-302 exam on Tuesday. It has been updated since the Beta considerably. Many who took the beta felt that it wasn&#39;t Architect focussed but more developer focussed. Now whilst in this new brave cloud world you have to be part Admin/Pre-Sales/Architect and Developer, writing C# or node.js code in an Architect Exam didn&#39;t seem fair to me either.</description>

      <description>An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the 70-533 exam last Wednesday. It was the version after the Jan 2018 updates. That last bit is critical. Cloud moves fast and Microsoft published the exam 4 years ago. It was originally based around ASM, the white and blue GUI and a different set of PowerShell commands. It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.</description>
