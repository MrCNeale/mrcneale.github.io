      <description>Like many I&amp;rsquo;m currently cramming for my VCAP-DCA.
The reason behind the cramming is that it&amp;rsquo;s on the 15th Jan and it&amp;rsquo;s DCA510 which has been retired so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t push it back despite not getting the voucher long ago or starting studying long ago enough.
That&amp;rsquo;s my excuses out of the way early.
So I could write my own blog posts breaking down the blueprint. Well that is useful to me, being able to explain something to a level where someone else can understand it is a good demonstration of your knowledge of something usually&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.
After a couple of hours spent building MetalBeard out of Lego I remembered and read it.
&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description>

      <description>I first commented on the VMware communities forums back in 2006 on an ESX 2.x related issue someone was having. I had a 7 years hiatus from 2007 to now :-)
I decided to start trawling the forums to answer people&amp;rsquo;s questions as part of my VCP5.
What? I hear you say. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that eating up into valuable revision time? Well I don&amp;rsquo;t think so and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
I use forums, and Google.</description>
