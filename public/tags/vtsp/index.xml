      <description>Morning all,
I sat my VCP4 a couple of weeks ago and managed to pass. It&amp;rsquo;s a tough exam and requires you to know about all aspects of VMWare&amp;rsquo;s offerings (but all detailed in the exam blueprint pdf!)
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you tips here as Scott Vessey&amp;rsquo;s blog invented that wheel and keeps it well maintained http://vmwaretraining.blogspot.com/ However through my company I did find out something interesting.
As we are a VMWare partner (and many of you who are working toward VCP are likely to be too, check with your manager or VMWare account manager) then you may have access to the VMWare Partner University.</description>
