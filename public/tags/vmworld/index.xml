      <description>I am here. I&amp;rsquo;m in Barcelona. Tomorrow I will be attending the partner day activities and following that such amazing things as the vExpert party!
I lie here in my Chintz Pink Hotel (Picture attached at the end) marvelling that this has actually come off.
I have spent 2-3 weeks sorting this out. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details but suffice to say the red tape I&amp;rsquo;ve had to negotiate has involved things that, in peace-time, no person should have to endure.</description>

      <description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.
After a couple of hours spent building MetalBeard out of Lego I remembered and read it.
&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description>
