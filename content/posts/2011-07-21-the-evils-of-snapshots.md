---
Been away from tech-blogging for a while now for a number of reasons, not least studying for vcp4.

On the way something came up at work which needed another blog post about it, despite many others doing the same!

Deleting snapshots, big ones especially, times out at 95% on  VI3 VCenter 2 leaving you all panicked and squeaky bum time.

The simple summary is that coalescing a 200gb snap could take up to 6hrs :-( so be patient.

These are the relevant links to save me retyping.  Read on!
