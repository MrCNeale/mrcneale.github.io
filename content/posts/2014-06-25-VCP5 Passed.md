title: VCP5 Passed - Grasp The Nettle! (VCAP next)
---
I sat my VCP5-DCV last Monday (a week ago Monday now) and passed.  450/500 so I am quite chuffed.

It was a great relief as I had devoted lots of lunchtimes and evenings and late nights into silly times in the morning to it.

I was so relieved that I haven't blogged or done anything out of work since!

I resumed things like going to the gym at lunch times (VCP5=Fat Nealo!), Gentlemen's Club on Tuesdays and spending some of my birthday money on a consumer binge of non-techy stuff. That's out of the way now, the honeymoon's over and it's time for the next challenge.  Having been spurred on by two colleagues at work I am plumping for VCAP-DCA. Why? It's a logical next step.  There's no barrier to it in terms of pre-requisite courses etc. as the VCP5-DCV qualifies me to sit it.  Plus my employer pays for the exams.

So in kind of closing the door on VCP (*until it expires) I'll sign off this section with some thanks.
