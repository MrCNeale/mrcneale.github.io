Firewall ports on the ESXi Host. I&amp;rsquo;m going to presume host and AD are on the same subnet, if not then you are responsible for checking routing and firewalls between Host and AD Domain Controllers are configure correctly Port 88 - Kerberos authentication
Port 123 – NTP
Port 135 - RPC</description></item><item><title>VMworld Europe Schedule and New things to do this time</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-08-vmworld-europe-schedule-and-todos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-08-vmworld-europe-schedule-and-todos/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve filled up my schedule, I&amp;rsquo;ve Favourited sessions that were full so I can check the standby queues out and here&amp;rsquo;s a few other things I want to tick off this time round at VMworld
I might have some tapas and a cerveza too. But just the one!</description></item><item><title>I am not a N00b! - Telling vCenter to stop showing you getting started pages!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-06-iamnotan00b/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-06-iamnotan00b/</guid><description>I should have found this years ago.
Like most of you reading this I get bugged by vCenter presuming this is my first Rodeo, as they say.
Everytime you go to a new Datacentre/Cluster/Folder/VM* (Delete as appropriate) it gives me the Getting Started pages.
So today I found the off switches:
For C# Client
For the Web Client
Job done. You are now L33t @ vCenter</description></item><item><title>All hail the PSC - Long Live the appliance!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-05-thepsc-ridesintotown-withcertificatesforall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-10-05-thepsc-ridesintotown-withcertificatesforall/</guid><description>VMware started as a Type 2 Hypervisor for doing a bit of lab/development testing on.
They&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since and even started chopping Windows out of the picture whenever possible. VCSA did a great job at removing not just vCenter but a number of the vSphere components like dump collector, log browser, syslog collector and auto deploy.
But to have a fully tidy and enterprise environment you needed certificates.</description></item><item><title>VCP-NV=EZ</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-08-16-vcp-nvez/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-08-16-vcp-nvez/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks now since I sat and passed the VCP-NV. Straight after the exam I went on holiday and on coming back I got straight back into work.
My background is working with VMware since Esx 2.x in 2005. In a more structured and career focussed way since 2011 when I did a great project to deploy 4 vBlocks with Linked vCenters. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on various virtualisation deployments, upgrades, support incidents (the joys of being on-call) and even a brief foray into setting up a Hyper-V environment for one customer!</description></item><item><title>The iSCSI Mystery (+Death to e1000s)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-08-11-the-iscsi-mystery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-08-11-the-iscsi-mystery/</guid><description>I was asked to look at an issue recently with bad IO performance on an SQL VM. SQLio tests were being run and the figures coming back were much lower than expected. There was a little bit of CPU Ready but only occasionally, and the environment was slightly overcommitted. However, after some quick investigation windows task manager showed that the iSCSI traffic was going over the Production Virtual NIC!?!?!
The VM had 2 NICs.</description></item><item><title>Training Resource Review - Pluralsight + Jason Nash's NSX Courses</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-04-08-training-resource-review-pluralsight-jason-nashs-nsx-courses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-04-08-training-resource-review-pluralsight-jason-nashs-nsx-courses/</guid><description>In a recent change of tack to my learning plan I&amp;rsquo;ve moved from revising VCAP-DCA to VCP-NV. This has been driven by a need for work to be familiar with NSX and Multi-Hypervisor Virtualised Networking too.
I did a couple of the NSX Hands On Labs last October at VMworld but other than a few terms, and the fact some bits looked a lot like vShield from the vCloud Suite most of it had leaked out of my brain.</description></item><item><title>VMware News Roundup - Announcement-ageddon!!!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-03-13-vmware-news-roundup-announcement-ageddon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-03-13-vmware-news-roundup-announcement-ageddon/</guid><description>There was armageddon, then snowmageddon and now announcementageddon.
Twitter is on fire with frantic retweeting and updates on what people are excited about on the VMware front. And there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to be excited about right now.
The biggest unsurprising but best bit is vSphere 6.0 goes GA. Now everyone can try long distance vmotion, VVols, 4vcpu Fault Tolerance, Instant Clone and more.

A quick reinstall of windows and install of VMWorkstation and I had a great lab to revise for VCAP-DCA510 in a hurry. However I had promised myself that I&amp;rsquo;d set aside £120 this month to max out my motherboard with another 16Gb.</description></item><item><title>vExpert - Why go for it?</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-10-07-vexpert-why-bother/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-10-07-vexpert-why-bother/</guid><description>I was driving home Friday night when my phone bleeped to tell me a colleague had DM&amp;rsquo;d me on Twitter. I made a mental note to check when I got home.
After a couple of hours spent building MetalBeard out of Lego I remembered and read it.
&amp;ldquo;Congratulations vExpert&amp;rdquo; it said. I checked the VMware blog and found this http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/10/vexpert-2014-q3-announcement.html#src=vmw_so_vex_cneal_850
I was very pleased that my efforts evangelising around virtualisation and in particular VMware had been recognised.</description></item><item><title>Allowing automated installs of newer VMtools than the host version (Caveat for Trend Deep Security)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-12-allowing-automated-installs-of-newer-vmtools-than-the-host-version-caveat-for-trend-deep-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-12-allowing-automated-installs-of-newer-vmtools-than-the-host-version-caveat-for-trend-deep-security/</guid><description>During a recent patching cycle VMtools across a set of VMs were updated to the latest version. This was to patch security vulnerabilities in the versions which were running to ensure the environment was as secure as possible for a PenTest which would go towards IL3 Accreditation.
Shavlik was good enough to oblige here and went out and patched lots of VMs with new VMtools automatically to the latest version.</description></item></channel></rss>
