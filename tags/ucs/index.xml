Ok so can we fix it?
Well the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t a black/white yes or no.
We are running the above UCS servers in 2 vBlocks. The first is a vBlock 100 the second is a vBlock 300.</description></item><item><title>VCP5 - Me and my virtual history</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-10-vcp5-me-and-my-virtual-history/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-10-vcp5-me-and-my-virtual-history/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m 37, work at a global IT services company with big customers. When I started in 2005 my first project was helping deploy 10s of ESX hosts. Yes &amp;ldquo;ESX&amp;rdquo; v2.5 &amp;ldquo;Virtual Infrastructure&amp;rdquo; hosts and Virtual Center 1.something or other. It&amp;rsquo;s 9 years ago now but we had multiple farms of 7 hosts (I think) which had shared LUNs, and all ran training courses. Each training course was 6 VMs. Only 1 was unique as a citrix presentation server v4 front-end.</description></item></channel></rss>
