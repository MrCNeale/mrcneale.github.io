Driven, like a lot of others, by the impending retirement of the exam that keeps getting extended...more on that later. This is a post in two parts, first the exam experience, second a few pondering on VMware Education&amp;rsquo;s current trajectory.
The Day Itself Here in the UK there are only 3, I believe, VCAP accredited test centres. I hopped on a train across to Leeds, that ended up being delayed and I only had time for a coffee and sandiwch before having to get started.</description></item><item><title>Getting Back on the Horse!

I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get the
VMware authorisation Pearson Vue confirmation and now A voucher (for the $$$ bit) from my lovely employer :-) Well ok the last bit has been all rubber stamped and approved but it's somewhere in our suppliers system to churn a handle to actual give me a code....anyway that's an aside, as soon as it comes through I'll be booking the exam on pearson giving myself 3months/12weeks to prep.</description></item><item><title>VTSP - VMWare Certification and Accreditation...not mutually exclusive!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-08-15-vtsp-vmware-certification-and-accreditation-not-mutually-exclusive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2011 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-08-15-vtsp-vmware-certification-and-accreditation-not-mutually-exclusive/</guid><description>Morning all,
I sat my VCP4 a couple of weeks ago and managed to pass. It&amp;rsquo;s a tough exam and requires you to know about all aspects of VMWare&amp;rsquo;s offerings (but all detailed in the exam blueprint pdf!)
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you tips here as Scott Vessey&amp;rsquo;s blog invented that wheel and keeps it well maintained http://vmwaretraining.blogspot.com/ However through my company I did find out something interesting.
As we are a VMWare partner (and many of you who are working toward VCP are likely to be too, check with your manager or VMWare account manager) then you may have access to the VMWare Partner University.</description></item></channel></rss>
