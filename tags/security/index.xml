I had set aside some time for study, arranged an exam voucher through work, booked it. All set. I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.</description></item><item><title>Get-Module AZ fails because Azure=Azerbaijan</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-10-28-get-module-az-fails-because-azureazerbaijan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-10-28-get-module-az-fails-because-azureazerbaijan/</guid><description>When is a Culture a Module? Including pre-req checks in your code is good practice&amp;hellip;.so you add it in.
In our Powershell scripts which require Azure Powershell cmdlets we have moved, as should anyone keeping abreast of releases, to Powershell Core.
But our checks to see if the Az Module is installed were giving mixed results.
Even though the commands all worked, Get-AzVM etc. the module check for &amp;ldquo;Az&amp;rdquo; returned nothing, blank, nada.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - AZ-103 Microsoft Azure Administrator</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-08-12-az-103-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-08-12-az-103-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</guid><description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-103 exam at the end of July, blog post is a little late due to some family stuff, but back on it now. I missed the deadline to do the transition exam, but that wasn't a big problem as they had replaced the previous requirement of two exams to get Azure Administrator (AZ-100 + AZ-101) down to just one in AZ-103 This exam felt very familiar.</description></item><item><title>Azure Instance Metadata Service Usage Examples</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-05-10-azure-instance-metadata-service-101/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-05-10-azure-instance-metadata-service-101/</guid><description>What does Azure have that VMware never had? AKA What is the Azure Instance Metadata Service? There&amp;rsquo;s probably a ton of answers here. But the one I was angling for is &amp;ldquo;Which vCenter is my VM running on?&amp;rdquo;
Who&amp;rsquo;d be crazy enough to lose a VM? Well you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised in enterprise estates that have been running for 10 years and Sue who managed the VM farm just retired and moved to Cypus so you can&amp;rsquo;t get hold of her to ask&amp;hellip; Anyway, what I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about it more useful than just finding out where your VM is if you (or your script/code) only has access inside the VM.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - AZ-302 Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Certification Transition</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-03-28-az-302-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-03-28-az-302-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</guid><description>NOW WITH LABS! - An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the AZ-302 exam on Tuesday. It has been updated since the Beta considerably. Many who took the beta felt that it wasn't Architect focussed but more developer focussed. Now whilst in this new brave cloud world you have to be part Admin/Pre-Sales/Architect and Developer, writing C# or node.js code in an Architect Exam didn't seem fair to me either.</description></item><item><title>Using the Azure Load Balancer in reverse to funnel all outgoing traffic via a single IP</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-07-16-azurelbasinternetgateway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2018 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-07-16-azurelbasinternetgateway/</guid><description>An Odd Request This implementation started from a SAP team who said they wanted to replicate, in Azure, the AWS Internet Gateway functionality. In particular the option for all outbound traffic from VMs to route via a single outbound IP. As you may know even if your default Azure VM does not have a Public IP assigned to it, it can still access the internet for things like windows updates etc.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - 70-533 Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions - (Post Jan 2018 Updates)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-03-06-exam-experience-70-533/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-03-06-exam-experience-70-533/</guid><description>An Updated Exam and Exam Format I sat the 70-533 exam last Wednesday. It was the version after the Jan 2018 updates. That last bit is critical. Cloud moves fast and Microsoft published the exam 4 years ago. It was originally based around ASM, the white and blue GUI and a different set of PowerShell commands. It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.</description></item><item><title>Gotcha when importing client certificates for Azure P2S VPN</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2017-10-17-gotcha-with-azure-p2s-vpn-certificates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2017-10-17-gotcha-with-azure-p2s-vpn-certificates/</guid><description>After waiting 30 minutes for my P2S VPN gateway to deploy in Azure I was obviously eager to get VPN-ing, who wouldn't be!

It&amp;rsquo;s something no-one should have to see, but sometimes, for brevity it happens. Someone hard codes a password in a script/program &amp;ldquo;just to test&amp;rdquo;. Well it&amp;rsquo;s a bad habit to get in to.</description></item><item><title>vSphere vApps unaffected by Back to 28 Vulnerability (CVE-2015-8370)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-12-20-grub-back-to-28-doesnt-affect-vmware/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-12-20-grub-back-to-28-doesnt-affect-vmware/</guid><description>Recently Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered a vulnerability in common Linux bootloader GRUB.
It affects GRUB2 specifically and was introduced into that version in 2009
http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2015-8370-Grub2-authentication-bypass.html
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8370
However it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the original GRUB.
I was concerned about the Virtual Appliances we were running in one of our environments.
