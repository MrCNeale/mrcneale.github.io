I was resetting a phone to sell on ebay. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been powered on for a while, and the clock was out by 3 years. As it had no SIM card in, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the time automatically from the Mobile Network provider. As soon as the time was set correctly then I could access web pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
