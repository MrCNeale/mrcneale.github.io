We recently had issues with some Devops tasks queuing. This was happening only with the tasks in the job that we run on our self-hosted agents.
Why run our own agents? It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable question. Microsoft provide agents (VMs) pre-configured and ready to run your tasks for you, so why mess about setting up your own?
There is usually a problem or configuration that cannot be solved using the Microsoft Pool of agents as they are selected at random and the only known quantity about them is that they will be selected from a pool that is in the same region as your DevOps Organisation.</description></item><item><title>Powershell to retreive Alerts which use a specific Action Group</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2021-05-14-powershell-to-retreive-alerts-which-use-a-specific-action-group/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2021-05-14-powershell-to-retreive-alerts-which-use-a-specific-action-group/</guid><description>Two simple queries help here:
To check if any Metric alerts point to your Action Group, run
Get-AzMetricAlertRuleV2 | ?{$_.actions.ActionGroupId -like &amp;#39;YourActionGroupName&amp;#39;} To check if any Log Alerts (Known as Scheduled Query alerts since classic was retired) run
Get-AzScheduledQueryRule | ?{$_.action.aznsaction.actiongroup -like &amp;#39;&amp;#39;YourActionGroupName&amp;#39;} Now you know if the Action Group is being used, and can be safely removed.</description></item><item><title>Powershell to retreive Azure VM Memory Size</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-04-27-powershell-to-retreive-azure-vm-memory-size/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-04-27-powershell-to-retreive-azure-vm-memory-size/</guid><description>Now you have the two parts of the puzzle, you just need to knit them together. First get a list of all your VMs (you could filter if you wanted)
$vms=get-azvm Now get a list of VM t-shirt sizes (I use eastus as it&amp;rsquo;s usually the most complete list of sizes)
$vmsizelist = Get-AzVMSize -Location eastus Now we loop through each vm, get it&amp;rsquo;s hardware profile. Read the VMSize property, then go find that row in the t-shirt size table, and find how much memory that t-shirt size has.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies (Microsoft Certified Azure Security Engineer Associate)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-02-11-az500examexperience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2020-02-11-az500examexperience/</guid><description>I spent a few nights watching some pre-recorded study sessions delivered by a colleague Dan Oliver which were great and covered all the material in the exam areas, in varying degrees of depth as they were 1-2hrs sessions.
It was watching these that reenforced my understanding that this was possibly the broadest area of Azure. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that security affects all things.
With the popularity of DevOPs and now DevSecOPs, we should all know that &amp;ldquo;Security should be baked in from the start&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Get-Module AZ fails because Azure=Azerbaijan</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-10-28-get-module-az-fails-because-azureazerbaijan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-10-28-get-module-az-fails-because-azureazerbaijan/</guid><description>Including pre-req checks in your code is good practice&amp;hellip;.so you add it in.
In our Powershell scripts which require Azure Powershell cmdlets we have moved, as should anyone keeping abreast of releases, to Powershell Core.
But our checks to see if the Az Module is installed were giving mixed results.
Even though the commands all worked, Get-AzVM etc. the module check for &amp;ldquo;Az&amp;rdquo; returned nothing, blank, nada.
But if you check for a sub module, e.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - AZ-103 Microsoft Azure Administrator</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-08-12-az-103-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-08-12-az-103-exam-experience-and-study-advice/</guid><description>This exam felt very familiar. The questions were not vastly changed from 70-533 which I sat last year, and the format was the same as AZ-302 in that the exam is divided into sections:
Traditional Multiple choice Scenario based multiple choice, where the same scenario will be offered for many questions and different solutions proposed. You have to answer if the proposed solution will meet the requirements Labs. Where you actually log in to an Azure Portal and do things.</description></item><item><title>Build a Docker container with a standard deployment environment</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-06-26-powershellazmodulesandgitindocker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-06-26-powershellazmodulesandgitindocker/</guid><description>Practical user for Docker/Containers in infra as code (IaC) - a standard deployment environment &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code, Automate all the things, Containers are the future, DevOPs to the max!&amp;rdquo; has been a chorus of lots of people in tech for a while and as a non-app dev I never really saw applications for containers to help what I do.

Azure VMs are great and VM extensions are even better. Either a Vendor, or you, can create some code to do a thing to a VM. Usually install software or agents and configure it. Most common for the average user will be things like the Log Analytics Agent Extension and the Custom Script Extension (where you can run your own Powershell or Bash post install).</description></item><item><title>Azure Instance Metadata Service Usage Examples</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-05-10-azure-instance-metadata-service-101/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2019-05-10-azure-instance-metadata-service-101/</guid><description>What does Azure have that VMware never had?

As usual the IaaS sections and IAM/AD/Security areas, which I have most background in were quite simple to absorb. Where I had to pay much more attention is around the PaaS/Serverless application space. So Web Apps, Functions, Batch, Event Grids etc.
This may be different for you, but where I am currently we&amp;rsquo;re still helping a lot of customers move from on-prem into cloud, so they haven&amp;rsquo;t expanded or transformed to start using PaaS services heavily.</description></item><item><title>OMS Agent Syslogs Not Collecting</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-12-13-omsagentsyslognomore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2018 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-12-13-omsagentsyslognomore/</guid><description>We use Log Analytics to collect logs so that we can query the pooled logs to generate alerts.

Similarly each VM will have different IPs. For a reason known to the SAP team, they needed all VMs to appear to be coming from the same IP.</description></item><item><title>Exam Experience - 70-533 Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions - (Post Jan 2018 Updates)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-03-06-exam-experience-70-533/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2018-03-06-exam-experience-70-533/</guid><description>It also had a number of other concepts which have been migrated over that time into Azure Resource Manager as a deployment method.
Initially that had me concerned as I came to Azure 12 months ago fresh onto ARM. It was new at first but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any ASM baggage.

When importing a VPN Client Cert and you are presented with the option to &amp;ldquo;Enable strong private key protection&amp;rdquo;, untick it. If you&amp;rsquo;re on a newer OS, you won&amp;rsquo;t get this prompt (tested on Server 2016). Now this is in the troubleshooting guide, but it should be in the instructions, rather than something you have to search for after the fact. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-troubleshoot-vpn-point-to-site-connection-problems
