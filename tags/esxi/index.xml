Your AD team ask what rights ESXi requires and you can&amp;rsquo;t tell them VMware Support give you a stock &amp;ldquo;You must have Domain Admins&amp;rdquo; reply to a support call. Solution Delegate the rights as per the following Microsoft KB Article https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/932455 &amp;hellip;yes I know it&amp;rsquo;s for 2003 but AD hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed that much since then&amp;hellip;shhh don&amp;rsquo;t tell!</description></item><item><title>VCP5 - NPIV, why? Because you can!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-08-vcp5-npiv-why-because-you-can/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-08-vcp5-npiv-why-because-you-can/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revising for a good few weeks now.
Setting up my homelab, being wowed by autodeploy installations and practising other things I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much exposure to in my day to day vSphere 5 usage. However I still had to cover those niggly bits that come under the heading:
&amp;ldquo;Never used this, probably never will, don&amp;rsquo;t understand it!&amp;rdquo;
NPIV was one of these. You&amp;rsquo;ll all have seen the questions if you&amp;rsquo;re preparing for the exam, or more often wonder why it&amp;rsquo;s there squirreled away on the options tab of a VMs configuration page.</description></item><item><title>VCP5 Study.

I had a 7 years hiatus from 2007 to now :-)
I decided to start trawling the forums to answer people&amp;rsquo;s questions as part of my VCP5.
What? I hear you say. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that eating up into valuable revision time? Well I don&amp;rsquo;t think so and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
I use forums, and Google.</description></item><item><title>VCP5 Revision WWTWCD - What Would The Web Client Do?!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-03-vcp5-revision-wwtwcd-what-would-the-web-client-do/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-06-03-vcp5-revision-wwtwcd-what-would-the-web-client-do/</guid><description>Very very brief one this, but it had me foxed for 5 minutes and time is precious!
I was looking into Distributed Virtual Switches and reading up on Port Bindings. I wanted to see what the options were (kinaesthetic learner me!)
Opened up my DVS in the vSphere client and right click, edit settings, and voila&amp;hellip;..!?
Erm the option is not there.
After checking the vSphere Docs online [embed]https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc%2FGUID-69933F6E-2442-46CF-AA17-1196CB9A0A09.html[/embed] I spotted the obvious.</description></item><item><title>VCP 5 - Objective 1.2 - Host/Configuration Tab (in essence!)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-30-vcp-5-objective-1-2-hostconfiguration-tab-in-essence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2014 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-30-vcp-5-objective-1-2-hostconfiguration-tab-in-essence/</guid><description>So here I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe what many possibly have done before, but it&amp;rsquo;s needed for the exam&amp;hellip;..so here goes.
Configure NTP on an ESXi host. Connect to the ESX/ESXi host using the vSphere Client. Click the Configuration tab. Click Time Configuration/Properties/Options/NTP Settings. Click Add. Enter the NTP Server name. Click OK. Click the General tab. Click Start automatically under Startup Policy. Click Start and click OK. Click OK to exit.</description></item><item><title>VCP5 Auto Deploy - Much more than just an automated ESXi install</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-15-vcp5-auto-deploy-much-more-than-just-an-automated-esxi-install/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2014-05-15-vcp5-auto-deploy-much-more-than-just-an-automated-esxi-install/</guid><description>Revision. It means to review (previously studied materials) according to dictionary.com
However as anyone who has ever studied for a tech exam knows it is usually the complete opposite! You know what you know. You work with it and click those options every day. BUT you know that the exam covers all the things you never use, some you may have never even looked at.

I have: HP N40L Microserver. If you&amp;rsquo;ve looked into a good cheap box to run ESXi on then you have surely come across this server or one of it&amp;rsquo;s more recent sped up relatives. Here are the quick specs It came slightly underspecced with only 2GB. That was quickly upped to 8GB. It can run 4-6 VMs comfortably depending on what spec you want to give them and how heavily they are utilised.</description></item><item><title>The evils of snapshots!</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-07-21-the-evils-of-snapshots/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-07-21-the-evils-of-snapshots/</guid><description>Been away from tech-blogging for a while now for a number of reasons, not least studying for vcp4.
On the way something came up at work which needed another blog post about it, despite many others doing the same!
Deleting snapshots, big ones especially, times out at 95% on VI3 VCenter 2 leaving you all panicked and squeaky bum time.
The simple summary is that coalescing a 200gb snap could take up to 6hrs :-( so be patient.</description></item><item><title>Supply and Demand : The Crazy Price of NICs</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-04-21-supply-and-demand-the-crazy-price-of-nics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2011 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2011-04-21-supply-and-demand-the-crazy-price-of-nics/</guid><description>Ok, so I want to have my own ESXi host at home. Initially it may sound like a tall order but there are lots of good community sites out there describing how to do it and what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
www.vm-help.com has a very good HWCL on it compiled from user experience. So after trying and failing to install ESXi 4.1 I found on vm-help that my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s on-board NIC isn&amp;rsquo;t compatible as there are no drivers on the installation CD for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
