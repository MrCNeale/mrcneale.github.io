We recently had issues with some Devops tasks queuing. This was happening only with the tasks in the job that we run on our self-hosted agents.
Why run our own agents? It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable question. Microsoft provide agents (VMs) pre-configured and ready to run your tasks for you, so why mess about setting up your own?
There is usually a problem or configuration that cannot be solved using the Microsoft Pool of agents as they are selected at random and the only known quantity about them is that they will be selected from a pool that is in the same region as your DevOps Organisation.</description></item><item><title>One cause and fix for Android phone connecting to a Wifi Network but "has no internet access"</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2021-10-11-wificonnectednointernetfix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2021-10-11-wificonnectednointernetfix/</guid><description>The one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see on any searches was &amp;ldquo;Set your Date &amp;amp; Time&amp;rdquo; correctly. I was resetting a phone to sell on ebay. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been powered on for a while, and the clock was out by 3 years. As it had no SIM card in, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the time automatically from the Mobile Network provider. As soon as the time was set correctly then I could access web pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
