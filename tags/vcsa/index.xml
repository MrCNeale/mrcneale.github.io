When I came to test logging in I got &amp;ldquo;invalid username/password&amp;rdquo; from the web-client.
Hmm odd. So I went back in and checked the username was spelt correctly and reset the password typing slowly.
Back out. Tried login again&amp;hellip;.same error. Ok maybe I&amp;rsquo;m being really fat fingered. Nope I typed the password into a notepad and it was correct.</description></item><item><title>vSphere vApps unaffected by Back to 28 Vulnerability (CVE-2015-8370)</title><link>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-12-20-grub-back-to-28-doesnt-affect-vmware/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrisneale.org/posts/2015-12-20-grub-back-to-28-doesnt-affect-vmware/</guid><description>Recently Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered a vulnerability in common Linux bootloader GRUB.
It affects GRUB2 specifically and was introduced into that version in 2009
http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2015-8370-Grub2-authentication-bypass.html
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8370
However it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the original GRUB.
I was concerned about the Virtual Appliances we were running in one of our environments.

Easy peasy. Any monkey could do that!
You config it from the webpage. Things like changing the default password, general good practice etc.
&amp;hellip;.and obviously you change the IP to a static one.
Wait! Stop! You just broke the VCA. Well you sort of did. You changed the name but didn&amp;rsquo;t update the SSL cert that was generated when it was first built/configured.</description></item></channel></rss>
