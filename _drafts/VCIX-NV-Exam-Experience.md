blueprint, last of the vcix/vcap 5esque dodgy rdp lab
looking forward to vcap6 HOL style lab <link to overview>

blueprint good, questions bad (ambiguous to the point of contradiction)
question A says do not do xyz, question B says ensure that you utilise existing items
to do that would  break the "do not do xyz" rule
It's this kind of ambiguity that would usually be very easily resolved in discussion with customers to understand 

their requirements.  No option to discuss, so ambiguity should be less and very limited to different technical ways 

of achieving a goal.

Questions were clear if a particular method was required, e.g. gui/esxcli/powercli/api 

even having done the exam, not enough time to complete all 18 items in given time....question if that's appropriate 

for a situation you are entering knowing "scope" but not exact issues??


mark arrived within 3hrs of completion
